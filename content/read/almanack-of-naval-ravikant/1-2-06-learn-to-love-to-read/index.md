### Learn to Love to Read

The genuine love for reading itself, when cultivated, is a superpower. We live in the age of Alexandria, when every book and every piece of knowledge ever written down is a fingertip away. The means of learning are abundant—it’s the desire to learn that is scarce. [3]

> Reading was my first love. [4]

I remember my grandparents’ house in India. I’d be a little kid on the floor going through all of my grandfather’s Reader’s Digests, which is all he had to read. Now, of course, there’s a smorgasbord of information out there—anybody can read anything all the time. Back then, it was much more limited. I would read comic books, storybooks, whatever I could get my hands on.

I think I always loved to read because I’m actually an antisocial introvert. I was lost in the world of words and ideas from an early age. I think some of it comes from the happy circumstance that when I was young, nobody forced me to read certain things.

I think there’s a tendency among parents and teachers to say, “Oh, you should read this, but don’t read that.” I read a lot which (by today’s standards) would be considered mental junk food. [4]

> Read what you love until you love to read.

You almost have to read the stuff you’re reading, because you’re into it. You don’t need any other reason. There’s no mission here to accomplish. Just read because you enjoy it.

These days, I find myself rereading as much (or more) as I do reading. A tweet from @illacertus said, “I don’t want to read everything. I just want to read the 100 great books over and over again.” I think there’s a lot to that idea. It’s really more about identifying the great books for you because different books speak to different people. Then, you can really absorb those.

> Reading a book isn’t a race—the better the book, the more slowly it should be absorbed.

I don’t know about you, but I have very poor attention. I skim. I speed read. I jump around. I could not tell you specific passages or quotes from books. At some deep level, you absorb them, and they become threads in the tapestry of your psyche. They kind of weave in there.

I’m sure you’ve had this feeling where you pick up a book and start reading it, and you’re like, “This is pretty interesting. This is pretty good.” You’re getting this increasing sense of deja vu. Then halfway through the book, you realize, “I’ve read this book before.” That’s perfectly fine. It means you were ready to reread it. [4]

> I don’t actually read a lot of books. I pick up a lot of books and only get through a few which form the foundation of my knowledge.

The reality is, I don’t actually read much compared to what people think. I probably read one to two hours a day. That puts me in the top .00001 percent. I think that alone accounts for any material success I’ve had in my life and any intelligence I might have. Real people don’t read an hour a day. Real people, I think, read a minute a day or less. Making it an actual habit is the most important thing.

It almost doesn’t matter what you read. Eventually, you will read enough things (and your interests will lead you there) that it will dramatically improve your life. Just like the best workout for you is one you’re excited enough to do every day, I would say for books, blogs, tweets, or whatever—anything with ideas and information and learning—the best ones to read are the ones you’re excited about reading all the time. [4]

> “As long as I have a book in my hand, I don’t feel like I’m wasting time.” —Charlie Munger

Everyone’s brain works differently. Some people love to take notes. Actually, my notetaking is Twitter. I read and read and read. If I have some fundamental “ah-ha” insight or concept, Twitter forces me to distill it into a few characters. Then I try and put it out there as an aphorism. Then I get attacked by random people who point out all kinds of obvious exceptions and jump down my throat. Then I think, “Why did I do this again?” [4]

> Pointing out obvious exceptions implies either the target isn’t smart or you aren’t.

**When you first pick up a book, are you skimming for something interesting? How do you go about reading it? Do you just flip to a random page and start reading? What’s your process?**

I’ll start at the beginning, but I’ll move fast. If it’s not interesting, I’ll just start flipping ahead, skimming, or speed reading. If it doesn’t grab my attention within the first chapter in a meaningful, positive way, I’ll either drop the book or skip ahead a few chapters.

I don’t believe in delayed gratification when there are an infinite number of books out there to read. There are so many great books.

> The number of books completed is a vanity metric. As you know more, you leave more books unfinished. Focus on new concepts with predictive power.

Generally, I’ll skim. I’ll fast forward. I’ll try and find a part to catch my attention. Most books have one point to make. (Obviously, this is nonfiction. I’m not talking about fiction.) They have one point to make, they make it, and then they give you example after example after example after example, and they apply it to explain everything in the world. Once I feel like I’ve gotten the gist, I feel very comfortable putting the book down. There’s a lot of these, what I would call pseudoscience bestsellers…People are like, “Oh, did you read this book?” I always say yes, but the reality is I read maybe two chapters of it. I got the gist.

> If they wrote it to make money, don’t read it.

**What practices do you follow to internalize/organize information from reading books?**

Explain what you learned to someone else. Teaching forces learning. It’s not about “educated” vs. “uneducated.”

> It’s about “likes to read” and “doesn’t like to read.”

**What can I do for the next sixty days to become a clearer, more independent thinker?**

Read the greats in math, science, and philosophy. Ignore your contemporaries and news. Avoid tribal identification. Put truth above social approval. [11]

> Study logic and math, because once you’ve mastered them, you won’t fear any book.

No book in the library should scare you. Whether it’s a math, physics, electrical engineering, sociology, or economics book. You should be able to take any book down off the shelf and read it. A number of them are going to be too difficult for you. That’s okay—read them anyway. Then go back and reread them and reread them.

When you’re reading a book and you’re confused, that confusion is similar to the pain you get in the gym when you’re working out. But you’re building mental muscles instead of physical muscles. Learn how to learn and read the books.

The problem with saying “just read” is there is so much junk out there. There are as many different kinds of authors as there are people. Many of them are going to write lots of junk.

I have people in my life I consider to be very well-read who aren’t very smart. The reason is because even though they’re very well-read, they read the wrong things in the wrong order. They started out reading a set of false or just weakly true things, and those formed the axioms of the foundation for their worldview. Then, when new things come, they judge the new idea based on a foundation they already built. Your foundation is critical.

> Because most people are intimidated by math and can’t independently critique it, they overvalue opinions backed with math/pseudoscience.

When it comes to reading, make sure your foundation is very, very high quality.

The best way to have a high-quality foundation (you may not love this answer), but the trick is to stick to science and to stick to the basics. Generally, there are only a few things you can read people don’t disagree with. Very few people disagree 2+2=4, right? That is serious knowledge. Mathematics is a solid foundation.

Similarly, the hard sciences are a solid foundation. Microeconomics is a solid foundation. The moment you start wandering outside of these solid foundations you’re in trouble because now you don’t know what’s true and what’s false. I would focus as much as I could on having solid foundations. I

t’s better to be really great at arithmetic and geometry than to be deep into advanced mathematics. I would read microeconomics all day long—Microeconomics 101.

Another way to do this is to read originals and read classics. If you’re interested in evolution, read Charles Darwin. Don’t begin with Richard Dawkins (even though I think he’s great). Read him later; read Darwin first.

If you want to learn macroeconomics, first read Adam Smith, read von Mises, or read Hayek. Start with the original philosophers of the economy. If you’re into communist or socialist ideas (which I’m personally not), start by reading Karl Marx. Don’t read the current interpretation someone is feeding you about how things should be done and run.

If you start with the originals as your foundations, then you have enough of a worldview and understanding that you won’t fear any book. Then you can just learn. If you’re a perpetual learning machine, you will never be out of options for how to make money. You can always see what’s coming up in society, what the value is, where the demand is, and you can learn to come up to speed. [74]

> To think clearly, understand the basics. If you’re memorizing advanced concepts without being able to re-derive them as needed, you’re lost.

We’re now in a day and age of Twitter and Facebook. We’re getting bite-sized, pithy wisdom, which is really hard to absorb. Books are very difficult to read as a modern person because we’ve been trained. We have two contradictory pieces of training:

One is our attention span has gone through the floor because we’re hit with so much information all the time. We want to skip, summarize, and cut to the chase.

> Twitter has made me a worse reader but a much better writer.

On the other hand, we’re also taught from a young age to finish your books. Books are sacred—when you go to school and you’re assigned to read a book, you have to finish the book. Over time, we forget how to read books. Everyone I know is stuck on some book.

I’m sure you’re stuck on something right now—it’s page 332, you can’t go any further, but you know you should finish the book. So what do you do? You give up reading books for a while.

For me, giving up reading was a tragedy. I grew up on books, then I switched to blogs, then I switched to Twitter and Facebook, and I realized I wasn’t actually learning anything. I was just taking little dopamine snacks all day long. I was getting my little 140-character burst of dopamine. I would Tweet, then look to see who retweeted my Tweet. It’s a fun and wonderful thing, but it’s a game I was playing.

I realized I had to go back to reading books. [6]

I knew it was a very hard problem because my brain had now been trained to spend time on Facebook, Twitter, and these other bite-sized pieces.

I came up with this hack where I started treating books as throwaway blog posts or bite-sized tweets or posts. I felt no obligation to finish any book. Now, when someone mentions a book to me, I buy it. At any given time, I’m reading somewhere between ten and twenty books. I’m flipping through them.

If the book is getting a little boring, I’ll skip ahead. Sometimes, I start reading a book in the middle because some paragraph caught my eye. I’ll just continue from there, and I feel no obligation whatsoever to finish the book. All of a sudden, books are back into my reading library. That’s great, because there is ancient wisdom in books. [6]

When solving problems: the older the problem, the older the solution.

If you’re trying to learn how to drive a car or fly a plane, you should read something written in the modern age because this problem was created in the modern age and the solution is great in the modern age.

If you’re talking about an old problem like how to keep your body healthy, how to stay calm and peaceful, what kinds of value systems are good, how you raise a family, and those kinds of things, the older solutions are probably better.

Any book that survived for two thousand years has been filtered through many people. The general principles are more likely to be correct. I wanted to get back into reading these sorts of books. [6]

> You know that song you can’t get out of your head? All thoughts work that way. Careful what you read.

> A calm mind, a fit body, and a house full of love.  
> These things cannot be bought.  
> They must be earned.

### 学会热爱阅读

培养出对阅读本身的真爱时，这就是一种超级能力。我们生活在亚历山大图书馆时代，每一本书和每一段记录下来的知识都唾手可得。学习的手段是丰富的——稀缺的是学习的欲望。[3]

> 阅读是我的初恋。[4]

我还记得我祖父母在印度的家。我小时候会坐在地板上，翻看我祖父所有的《读者文摘》，那是他唯一的读物。当然，现在有一大堆信息——任何人随时可以阅读任何东西。而当时，选择非常有限。我会读漫画书、故事书，任何我能找到的东西。

我想我一直喜欢阅读，因为我实际上是个反社会的内向者。从小我就迷失在文字和思想的世界里。我觉得部分原因是幸运地在我年轻的时候，没人强迫我去读特定的东西。

我认为家长和老师有一种倾向，就是说：“哦，你应该读这个，但不要读那个。”我读了很多现在看来被认为是“精神垃圾食品”的书籍。[4]

> 读你喜欢的书，直到你爱上阅读。

你几乎必须去读那些让你感兴趣的东西，因为你本身就对它着迷。你不需要任何其他理由。没有什么任务需要完成。只是因为你喜欢而去读。

这些天，我发现自己重读的次数和阅读新书的次数差不多（甚至更多）。@illacertus 发的推文说：“我不想读所有的书。我只想一遍又一遍地读那100本伟大的书。”我觉得这个观点很有道理。真正重要的是找出对你来说伟大的书，因为不同的书会对不同的人产生共鸣。然后，你就可以真正吸收那些书。

> 读一本书不是一场竞赛——书越好，吸收得就越慢。

我不知道你怎么样，但我注意力很差。我浏览，快速阅读，跳来跳去。我无法告诉你书中的具体段落或引文。在某种深层次上，你吸收了它们，它们成了你心理图景中的一根根线条，它们在那里交织。

我相信你也有过这种感觉，当你拿起一本书开始读的时候，你觉得：“这挺有趣的，这挺好的。”你有一种越来越强烈的既视感。然后在书读到一半时，你意识到：“我之前读过这本书。”这完全没问题，这意味着你已经准备好重读它了。[4]

> 我其实并不读很多书。我拿起很多书，但只通过一些书奠定了我的知识基础。

实际上，我的阅读量并没有人们想象中的那么多。我大概每天读一到两个小时。这让我进入了前0.00001%的行列。我觉得这仅仅就能解释我在人生中取得的任何物质成功和我可能拥有的任何智慧。现实中，普通人不会每天阅读一小时。我觉得普通人每天读书的时间是一分钟甚至更少。让它成为一种习惯是最重要的事。

读什么几乎不重要。最终你会读到足够多的东西（你的兴趣会引导你），它们会极大地改善你的生活。就像最适合你的锻炼是你每天都很兴奋去做的锻炼，我会说对于书籍、博客、推文，或者任何包含思想、信息和学习的东西，最适合你读的就是那些你随时都很兴奋阅读的东西。[4]

> “只要我手里有书，我就不觉得自己是在浪费时间。”——查理·芒格

每个人的大脑运作方式都不同。有些人喜欢做笔记。实际上，我的笔记是在推特上完成的。我不断地阅读。如果我有某种基本的“啊哈”顿悟或概念，推特会迫使我把它浓缩成几句话。然后我试着把它以格言的形式发布出去。然后会有随机的人来攻击我，指出各种明显的例外，并对我冷嘲热讽。然后我会想：“我为什么要这样做？”[4]

> 指出明显的例外要么暗示目标不聪明，要么是你不聪明。

**当你第一次拿起一本书，你是在寻找有趣的内容吗？你是如何开始阅读的？你会随便翻到某一页然后开始读吗？你的过程是什么？**

我会从开头开始，但我会快速阅读。如果它不有趣，我会快速翻阅，浏览，或者快速阅读。如果第一章不能在某种意义上吸引我的注意，我会放下这本书，或者跳过几章。

在有无数的书可以读的情况下，我不相信延迟满足。有很多伟大的书。

> 完成的书籍数量是虚荣指标。当你知道的越多，未完成的书籍就会越多。关注具有预测力的新概念。

通常，我会浏览。我会快进。我会试着找到某个部分来引起我的注意。大多数书籍都有一个核心点。（显然，这是指非虚构类的书籍。我不是在说小说。）它们有一个要表达的点，表达出来后就不断给你例子，然后用它来解释世界上的一切。当我觉得自己已经抓住了精髓时，我就很舒服地放下书。有很多这类我称之为伪科学的畅销书...人们会说：“哦，你读过这本书吗？”我总是说是的，但实际上我可能只读了两章。我抓住了精髓。

> 如果他们写这本书是为了赚钱，不要读它。

**你有哪些习惯来内化或组织阅读书籍中获得的信息？**

把你学到的东西解释给别人。教学促进学习。这不是关于“受过教育”或“未受过教育”。

> 这是关于“喜欢阅读”和“不喜欢阅读”。

**未来六十天里，我能做什么来成为一个更加清晰、更加独立的思考者？**

阅读数学、科学和哲学的经典作品。忽略你的同代人和新闻。避免部落认同。将真理置于社会认同之上。[11]

> 学习逻辑和数学，因为一旦你掌握了它们，你将不再惧怕任何书。

图书馆里的任何一本书都不应该吓到你。不管是数学、物理学、电气工程、社会学，还是经济学的书。你应该能够从书架上取下任何一本书并阅读它。其中有一些会对你来说太难了。没关系——还是读它们。然后回去重读，再次重读。

当你读一本书而感到困惑时，这种困惑就像你在健身房锻炼时的疼痛，但你是在锻炼精神肌肉。学会学习，阅读这些书。

“只要去读”这个建议有个问题，那就是垃圾书太多了。作者有多少种类，人就有多少种类。他们中的很多人会写很多垃圾。

我生活中有些人，我认为他们读了很多书，但他们并不聪明。原因在于，即使他们读了很多书，但他们读了错误的东西，而且顺序不对。他们开始阅读了一些错误的或仅仅是弱真理的东西，这些东西成了他们世界观的基础。然后，当新的思想出现时，他们会基于已经建立的基础来评判新想法。你的基础至关重要。

> 因为大多数人被数学吓倒，无法独立批评它，所以他们会高估那些有数学/伪科学支持的观点。

在阅读时，确保你的基础非常非常高质量。

拥有高质量基础的最佳方式（你可能不喜欢这个答案），但诀窍就是坚持科学和基础知识。通常情况下，只有少数几样东西是没人会反对的。很少有人反对 2+2=4，对吧？这就是严肃的知识。数学是一个坚实的基础。

同样，硬科学也是坚实的基础。微观经济学是一个坚实的基础。一旦你开始偏离这些坚实的基础，你就陷入了麻烦，因为现在你不知道什么是真的，什么是假的。我会尽可能专注于拥有坚实的基础。

掌握基础算术和几何比深度研究高等数学要好得多。我会整天阅读微观经济学——微观经济学101。

另一种方式是阅读原著和经典。如果你对进化感兴趣，那就读查尔斯·达尔文的书。不要先读理查德·道金斯（尽管我认为他很棒）。先读达尔文，之后再读他。

如果你想学习宏观经济学，首先读亚当·斯密，读冯·米塞斯，或读哈耶克。先读经济学的原始哲学家。如果你对共产主义或社会主义思想感兴趣（我个人不是），就先读马克思。不要读别人现在告诉你应该如何做、如何运行的解释。

如果你以原著作为基础，那么你会有足够的世界观和理解力，不会害怕任何书籍。然后你就可以学习。如果你是一个永远学习的机器，你将永远不会缺少如何赚钱的选择。你总是能看到社会上正在发生什么，价值在哪里，需求在哪里，你就能学会跟上。[74]

> 为了清晰地思考，理解基础知识。如果你只是记住高级概念而不能在需要时重新推导它们，那么你就迷失了。

我们现在处于推特和Facebook的时代。我们得到了片段式的、俏皮的智慧，这真的很难吸收。作为现代人，书籍非常难以阅读，因为我们受过两种矛盾的训练：

一方面，我们的注意力已经大幅下降，因为我们一直被大量的信息冲击。我们想跳过、总结、直奔主题。

> 推特让我成了一个糟糕的读者，但一个更好的作者。

另一方面，我们从小就被教导要把书读完。书是神圣的——当你去学校，老师让你读一本书时，你必须把它读完。久而久之，我们忘记了如何读书。我认识的每个人都卡在某本书上。

我相信你现在也有一本卡住的书——已经到了第332页，但你无法继续下去，可你知道自己应该读完这本书。那你怎么办？你暂时放弃了读书。

对我来说，放弃阅读是一个悲剧。我从小在书籍中成长，后来转向了博客，再后来是推特和Facebook，后来我意识到我实际上什么都没学到。我只是在整天吃小剂量的“多巴胺零食”。我得到了一小段140个字符的多巴胺爆发。我会发推，然后看看谁转发了我的推特。这是一个有趣而美好的事情，但它是我在玩的一种游戏。

我意识到我必须重新开始读书。[6]

我知道这是一个非常棘手的问题，因为我的大脑现在已经被训练去花时间在Facebook、推特和其他这些片段式的信息上。

我想出了一个办法，我开始把书籍当作一次性的博客文章或片段的推文或帖子。我觉得没有任何义务要读完任何一本书。现在，当有人向我提到一本书时，我就买它。在任何时候，我都在读十到二十本书。我会随意翻阅它们。

如果这本书有点无聊，我会跳过。有时候，我会从中间开始读，因为某段话引起了我的兴趣。我就从那里继续，没有任何义务一定要读完这本书。突然之间，书籍又回到了我的阅读库中。这很棒，因为书中有古老的智慧。[6]

解决问题时：越老的问题，越老的解决方案。

如果你想学如何开车或飞行，你应该读现代时代写的东西，因为这个问题是在现代时代创造的，解决方案在现代时代也非常好。

如果你谈论的是一个老问题，比如如何保持身体健康，如何保持冷静和平和，什么样的价值体系是好的，如何养家糊口，这些事情，越老的解决方案可能越好。

任何一本存在了两千年的书都经过了很多人的筛选。一般的原则更可能是正确的。我想重新阅读这种书籍。[6]

> 你知道那首挥之不去的歌吗？所有的想法都以这种方式运作。小心你所阅读的东西。

> 平静的心态、健康的身体和充满爱的家庭。
> 这些东西无法购买。
> 它们必须通过努力获得。
