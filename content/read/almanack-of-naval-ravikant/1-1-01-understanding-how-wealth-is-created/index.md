### Understand How Wealth Is Created

I like to think that if I lost all my money and you dropped me on a random street in any English-speaking country, within five or ten years I’d be wealthy again because it’s just a skillset I’ve developed that anyone can develop. [78]

It’s not really about hard work. You can work in a restaurant eighty hours a week, and you’re not going to get rich. Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. Yes, hard work matters, and you can’t skimp on it. But it has to be directed in the right way.

If you don’t know yet what you should work on, the most important thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be working on.

I came up with the principles in my tweetstorm (below) for myself when I was really young, around thirteen or fourteen. I’ve been carrying them in my head for thirty years, and I’ve been living them. Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that created wealth.

This is exactly what I did my famous tweetstorm about. Of course, every one of these tweets can be extrapolated into an hour’s worth of conversation. The tweetstorm below is a good starting point. The tweetstorm tries to be information-dense, very concise, high-impact, and timeless. It has all the information and principles, so if you absorb these and you work hard over ten years, you’ll get what you want. [77]

> How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky):  
> ↓  
> Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.  
> ↓  
> Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.  
> ↓  
> Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.  
> ↓  
> You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom.  
> ↓  
> You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.  
> ↓  
> Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.  
> ↓  
> The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.  
> ↓  
> Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.  
> ↓  
> Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.  
> ↓  
> Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.  
> ↓  
> Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.  
> ↓  
> Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.  
> ↓  
> Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.  
> ↓  
> Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.  
> ↓  
> Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.  
> ↓  
> When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.  
> ↓  
> Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.  
> ↓  
> Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.  
> ↓  
> “Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.”  
> —Archimedes  
> ↓  
> Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).  
> ↓  
> Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgment.  
> ↓  
> Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.  
> ↓  
> Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.  
> ↓  
> Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.  
> ↓  
> An army of robots is freely available—it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.  
> ↓  
> If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.  
> ↓  
> Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.  
> ↓  
> Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.  
> ↓  
> There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.  
> ↓  
> Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.  
> ↓  
> Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.  
> ↓  
> You should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.  
> ↓  
> Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.  
> ↓  
> Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.  
> ↓  
> Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.  
> ↓  
> There are no get-rich-quick schemes. Those are just someone else getting rich off you.  
> ↓  
> Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.  
> ↓  
> When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another day. [11]

> Summary: Productize Yourself

**Your summary says “Productize yourself”—what does that mean?**

“Productize” and “yourself.” “Yourself ” has uniqueness. “Productize” has leverage. “Yourself” has accountability. “Productize” has specific knowledge. “Yourself ” also has specific knowledge in there. So all of these pieces, you can combine them into these two words.

If you’re looking toward the long-term goal of getting wealthy, you should ask yourself, “Is this authentic to me? Is it myself that I am projecting?” And then, “Am I productizing it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with capital or with code or with media?” So it’s a very handy, simple mnemonic. [78]

This is hard. This is why I say it takes decades—I’m not saying it takes decades to execute, but the better part of a decade may be figuring out what you can uniquely provide. [10]

**What’s the difference between wealth and money?**

Money is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. It is the ability to have credits and debits of other people’s time.

If I do my job right, if I create value for society, society says, “Oh, thank you. We owe you something in the future for the work you did in the past. Here’s a little IOU. Let’s call that money.” [78]

Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses.

Even a house can be a form of wealth, because you can rent it out, although that’s probably a lower productivity use of land than some commercial enterprise.

So, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep. [78]

> Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone.

Society will pay you for creating things it wants. But society doesn’t yet know how to create those things, because if it did, they wouldn’t need you. They would already be stamped out.

Almost everything in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time. There was a time when oil was a technology that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. There was a time when cars were technology that made Henry Ford rich.

So, technology is the set of things, as Alan Kay said, that don’t quite work yet [correction: Danny Hillis]. Once something works, it’s no longer technology. Society always wants new things. And if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get but it will want and providing it is natural to you, within your skill set, and within your capabilities.

Then, you have to figure out how to scale it because if you only build one, that’s not enough. You’ve got to build thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions, or billions of them so everybody can have one. Steve Jobs (and his team, of course) figured out society would want smartphones. A computer in their pocket that had all the phone capability times one hundred and was easy to use. So, they figured out how to build it, and then they figured out how to scale it. [78]

# 第一部分 - 财富

> 如何在不依赖运气的情况下变得富有。

## 创造财富

> 赚钱不是你做的某件事，而是一种你学会的技能。

### 理解财富是如何创造的

我喜欢想象，如果我失去了所有的钱，然后你把我扔在任何一个说英语的国家的街头，五到十年内我会再次变得富有，因为这只是一项我学会的技能，而任何人都可以学习这种技能。[78]

这并不完全是关于努力工作。你可以在餐厅里每周工作八十个小时，但这并不会让你变得富有。致富在于知道做什么、和谁一起做以及何时去做。这更多是关于理解而不仅仅是努力工作。是的，努力工作很重要，你不能偷懒，但必须朝正确的方向努力。

如果你还不知道自己应该做什么，最重要的就是先弄清楚这一点。在弄清楚应该做什么之前，不要盲目地拼命工作。

我在下面的推特风暴中总结的原则，是我在非常年轻的时候（大概十三或十四岁）为自己提出的。我已经在脑海中存储了它们三十年，并且一直在实践。随着时间的推移（无论是可悲的还是幸运的），我变得非常擅长的是观察企业，并找到创造财富的最大杠杆点并从中获取一些财富。

这正是我在那次著名的推特风暴中所做的。当然，每一条推文都可以展开成一小时的讨论。以下的推特风暴是一个很好的起点。这些推文尽力做到信息密集、简洁有力且具有持久的影响力。它包含了所有的信息和原则，如果你吸收了这些并且在十年间努力工作，你将得到你想要的结果。[77]

> 如何致富（无需依靠运气）：  
> ↓  
> 寻求财富，而不是金钱或地位。财富是那些在你睡觉时仍然为你赚钱的资产。金钱是我们如何转移时间和财富的工具。地位是你在社会等级中的位置。  
> ↓  
> 理解道德地创造财富是可能的。如果你心底里鄙视财富，它就会远离你。  
> ↓  
> 无视那些玩地位游戏的人。他们通过攻击那些在创造财富的人来获取地位。  
> ↓  
> 通过出租你的时间是不会变得富有的。你必须拥有股权——一部分企业——来获得财务自由。  
> ↓  
> 通过给社会提供它想要但尚不知道如何获取的东西，你会变得富有。而且是大规模的。  
> ↓  
> 选择一个你可以和长期志同道合的人进行长期游戏的行业。  
> ↓  
> 互联网大大拓宽了职业发展的可能空间。大多数人还没有意识到这一点。  
> ↓  
> 玩重复进行的游戏。生活中的所有回报，无论是财富、关系还是知识，都是复利的结果。  
> ↓  
> 选择商业伙伴时要有高智商、活力，并且最重要的是要有诚信。  
> ↓  
> 不要与愤世嫉俗者和悲观主义者合作。他们的信念会自我实现。  
> ↓  
> 学会销售，学会创造。如果你两者都能做到，你将无可阻挡。  
> ↓  
> 用具体的知识、责任感和杠杆武装自己。  
> ↓  
> 具体的知识是无法通过训练获得的。如果社会可以训练你，它也可以训练别人来取代你。  
> ↓  
> 具体的知识来自于追求你的真正好奇心和热情，而不是追逐当前的热点。  
> ↓  
> 建立具体的知识对你来说就像玩耍，但在别人看来却像工作。  
> ↓  
> 当具体的知识被传授时，通常是通过学徒制，而不是学校。  
> ↓  
> 具体的知识往往是高度技术化或创造性的。它无法外包或自动化。  
> ↓  
> 接受责任，并以自己的名义承担商业风险。社会会以责任、股权和杠杆来奖励你。  
> ↓  
> “给我一个足够长的杠杆和一个支点，我就能撬动地球。”  
> —阿基米德  
> ↓  
> 财富需要杠杆。商业杠杆来自资本、人力，以及没有复制边际成本的产品（如代码和媒体）。  
> ↓  
> 资本意味着金钱。为了筹集资金，应用你的具体知识，承担责任，并展现出良好的判断力。  
> ↓  
> 劳动力意味着为你工作的人。这是最古老且争斗最多的杠杆形式。劳动力杠杆会让你的父母感到印象深刻，但不要把你的生活浪费在追逐它上面。  
> ↓  
> 资本和劳动力是有许可的杠杆。每个人都在追逐资本，但有人必须给你资本。每个人都想领导，但也有人必须跟随你。  
> ↓  
> 代码和媒体是无许可的杠杆。它们是新富背后的杠杆。你可以创建软件和媒体，在你睡觉时也为你工作。  
> ↓  
> 一支机器人大军随时可用——它们只是为了热量和空间效率被装在数据中心里。使用它吧。  
> ↓  
> 如果你不会编程，那就写书和博客，录制视频和播客。  
> ↓  
> 杠杆是对你判断力的倍增器。  
> ↓  
> 判断力需要经验，但可以通过学习基础技能更快地建立。  
> ↓  
> 没有“商业”这种技能。避免商业杂志和商业课程。  
> ↓  
> 学习微观经济学、博弈论、心理学、说服、伦理学、数学和计算机。  
> ↓  
> 阅读比听更快。实践比观看更快。  
> ↓  
> 你应该忙到没时间“喝咖啡”，但仍保持一个清晰的日程表。  
> ↓  
> 设定并坚持执行一个有抱负的个人时薪。如果解决问题的收益低于你的时薪，忽略它。如果外包任务的费用低于你的时薪，外包它。  
> ↓  
> 尽可能努力工作，尽管你与谁合作和你在做什么比你工作有多努力更重要。  
> ↓  
> 成为你所在领域的全球最佳。不断重新定义你的工作，直到这是事实。  
> ↓  
> 没有快速致富的计划。那些只是别人从你身上致富的方式。  
> ↓  
> 应用具体的知识，并加上杠杆，最终你会得到你应得的回报。  
> ↓  
> 当你最终变得富有时，你会意识到这并不是你最初追求的东西。但这是后话了。[11]

> 总结：将自己产品化

**你的总结写道“将自己产品化”—这是什么意思？**

“产品化”和“你自己”。“你自己”代表独特性，“产品化”代表杠杆。“你自己”代表责任，“产品化”代表具体的知识。“你自己”也包含具体的知识。因此，这些部分可以组合成这两个词。

如果你朝着长期致富的目标前进，你应该问自己：“这对我是真实的吗？我是在展现自己吗？”然后，“我是否在将它产品化？我是否在扩展它？我是在通过劳动力、资本、代码还是媒体进行扩展？”所以，这是一个非常方便、简单的记忆工具。[78]

这很难。这就是为什么我说需要几十年—我并不是说需要几十年才能执行，而是需要更好的一部分时间来弄清楚你可以独特地提供什么。[10]

**财富和金钱有什么区别？**

金钱是我们如何转移财富的方式。金钱是社会的信用。它是拥有他人时间的借贷能力。

如果我做得好，如果我为社会创造了价值，社会就会说：“哦，谢谢你。我们欠你一些未来的回报，感谢你为我们过去做的工作。这是一个小小的欠条。我们称之为金钱。”[78]

财富是你想要的东西。财富是那些在你睡觉时仍然为你赚钱的资产。财富是工厂、机器人在生产东西。财富是夜间运行的计算机程序，服务于其他客户。财富甚至是银行里的钱，它们被再投资到其他资产和企业中。

即使是房子也可以是一种财富，因为你可以出租它，尽管这可能是土地生产率较低的用途，相比于某些商业企业。

所以，我对财富的定义更倾向于那些可以在你睡觉时仍然赚钱的企业和资产。[78]

> 技术让消费民主化，但让生产集中化。世界上最优秀的人可以为所有人服务。

社会会为你创造它想要的东西付钱。但社会还不知道如何创造这些东西，因为如果知道，他们就不需要你了，它们已经被批量生产了。

你家里、工作场所和街道上的几乎所有东西在某个时间点都曾是技术。有段时间，石油是一种让约翰·D·洛克菲勒致富的技术。有段时间，汽车是一种让亨利·福特致富的技术。

所以，技术是一组如艾伦·凯（纠正：丹尼·希利斯）所说的“还没有完全奏效的东西”。一旦某样东西开始奏效，它就不再是技术。社会总是需要新事物。如果你想致富，你需要弄清楚哪些你能为社会提供的东西，它还不知道如何获取，但会想要。而这些东西是你擅长的，符合你的技能和能力。

然后，你需要弄清楚如何扩展它，因为如果你只生产一个，那是不够的。你需要生产成千上万，数百万甚至数十亿个，以便每个人都能拥有一个。史蒂夫·乔布斯（当然还有他的团队）想到了社会需要智能手机—一个放在口袋里的电脑，具备电话功能且百倍易用。所以他们想出了如何制造它，然后想出了如何大规模生产。[78]
