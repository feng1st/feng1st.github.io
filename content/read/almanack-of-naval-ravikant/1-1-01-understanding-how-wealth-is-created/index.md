## BUILDING WEALTH

> Making money is not a thing you do—it’s a skill you learn.

### Understand How Wealth Is Created

I like to think that if I lost all my money and you dropped me on a random street in any English-speaking country, within five or ten years I’d be wealthy again because it’s just a skillset I’ve developed that anyone can develop. [78]

It’s not really about hard work. You can work in a restaurant eighty hours a week, and you’re not going to get rich. Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. Yes, hard work matters, and you can’t skimp on it. But it has to be directed in the right way.

If you don’t know yet what you should work on, the most important thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be working on.

I came up with the principles in my tweetstorm (below) for myself when I was really young, around thirteen or fourteen. I’ve been carrying them in my head for thirty years, and I’ve been living them. Over time (sadly or fortunately), the thing I got really good at was looking at businesses and figuring out the point of maximum leverage to actually create wealth and capture some of that created wealth.

This is exactly what I did my famous tweetstorm about. Of course, every one of these tweets can be extrapolated into an hour’s worth of conversation. The tweetstorm below is a good starting point. The tweetstorm tries to be information-dense, very concise, high-impact, and timeless. It has all the information and principles, so if you absorb these and you work hard over ten years, you’ll get what you want. [77]

> How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky):  
> ↓  
> Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.  
> ↓  
> Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.  
> ↓  
> Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.  
> ↓  
> You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom.  
> ↓  
> You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.  
> ↓  
> Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.  
> ↓  
> The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.  
> ↓  
> Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.  
> ↓  
> Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.  
> ↓  
> Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.  
> ↓  
> Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.  
> ↓  
> Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.  
> ↓  
> Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.  
> ↓  
> Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.  
> ↓  
> Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.  
> ↓  
> When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.  
> ↓  
> Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.  
> ↓  
> Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.  
> ↓  
> “Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.”  
> —Archimedes  
> ↓  
> Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).  
> ↓  
> Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgment.  
> ↓  
> Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.  
> ↓  
> Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.  
> ↓  
> Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.  
> ↓  
> An army of robots is freely available—it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.  
> ↓  
> If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.  
> ↓  
> Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.  
> ↓  
> Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.  
> ↓  
> There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.  
> ↓  
> Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.  
> ↓  
> Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.  
> ↓  
> You should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.  
> ↓  
> Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.  
> ↓  
> Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.  
> ↓  
> Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.  
> ↓  
> There are no get-rich-quick schemes. Those are just someone else getting rich off you.  
> ↓  
> Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.  
> ↓  
> When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another day. [11]

> Summary: Productize Yourself

**Your summary says “Productize yourself”—what does that mean?**

“Productize” and “yourself.” “Yourself ” has uniqueness. “Productize” has leverage. “Yourself” has accountability. “Productize” has specific knowledge. “Yourself ” also has specific knowledge in there. So all of these pieces, you can combine them into these two words.

If you’re looking toward the long-term goal of getting wealthy, you should ask yourself, “Is this authentic to me? Is it myself that I am projecting?” And then, “Am I productizing it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with capital or with code or with media?” So it’s a very handy, simple mnemonic. [78]

This is hard. This is why I say it takes decades—I’m not saying it takes decades to execute, but the better part of a decade may be figuring out what you can uniquely provide. [10]

**What’s the difference between wealth and money?**

Money is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. It is the ability to have credits and debits of other people’s time.

If I do my job right, if I create value for society, society says, “Oh, thank you. We owe you something in the future for the work you did in the past. Here’s a little IOU. Let’s call that money.” [78]

Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses.

Even a house can be a form of wealth, because you can rent it out, although that’s probably a lower productivity use of land than some commercial enterprise.

So, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep. [78]

> Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone.

Society will pay you for creating things it wants. But society doesn’t yet know how to create those things, because if it did, they wouldn’t need you. They would already be stamped out.

Almost everything in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time. There was a time when oil was a technology that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. There was a time when cars were technology that made Henry Ford rich.

So, technology is the set of things, as Alan Kay said, that don’t quite work yet [correction: Danny Hillis]. Once something works, it’s no longer technology. Society always wants new things. And if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get but it will want and providing it is natural to you, within your skill set, and within your capabilities.

Then, you have to figure out how to scale it because if you only build one, that’s not enough. You’ve got to build thousands, or hundreds of thousands, or millions, or billions of them so everybody can have one. Steve Jobs (and his team, of course) figured out society would want smartphones. A computer in their pocket that had all the phone capability times one hundred and was easy to use. So, they figured out how to build it, and then they figured out how to scale it. [78]

# 第一部分 - 财富

> 如何在不靠运气的情况下致富。

## 创造财富

> 赚钱不是你做的事情，而是一种你学习的技能。

### 理解财富是如何创造的

我喜欢想象，如果我失去了所有的钱，然后你把我扔在任何一个说英语的国家的随机街道上，在五到十年内我会再次变得富有，因为这是一种我已经掌握的技能，任何人都可以学会这种技能。[78]

这不完全是关于辛苦工作。你可以在餐馆里一周工作八十个小时，但你不会因此变得富有。致富是关于知道做什么、和谁做、什么时候做。理解比单纯的辛苦工作更重要。是的，辛苦工作很重要，而且你不能偷懒。但它必须要朝着正确的方向。

如果你还不知道你应该做什么，最重要的就是去弄明白。你不应该在没有找到应该做什么之前就投入大量的辛苦工作。

我在很年轻的时候，大概十三或十四岁时，提出了我在推特上发的这些原则，并在心中一直记着，已经三十年了，我也一直在践行这些原则。随着时间的推移（遗憾或幸运的是），我真正擅长的事情就是观察企业，找出创造财富的最大杠杆点，并捕捉到一部分财富。

这正是我所做的著名推特风暴的内容。当然，每一条推文都可以延伸出一小时的对话。以下的推特风暴是一个很好的起点。推特风暴尝试信息密集、简洁高效、并且具有永恒的影响力。如果你吸收了这些内容并在十年内努力工作，你会得到你想要的东西。[77]

> 如何致富（不靠运气）：  
> ↓  
> 追求财富，而不是金钱或地位。财富是你在睡觉时也能赚取收益的资产。金钱是我们转移时间和财富的方式。地位是你在社会阶层中的位置。  
> ↓  
> 理解创造财富是可以符合道德的。如果你在内心鄙视财富，它就会远离你。  
> ↓  
> 忽略那些玩地位游戏的人。他们通过攻击那些创造财富的人来获取地位。  
> ↓  
> 你不可能通过租用自己的时间变得富有。你必须拥有股权——也就是某个企业的一部分，才能获得财务自由。  
> ↓  
> 你会通过为社会提供它想要但尚不知道如何得到的东西来致富，而且要做到规模化。  
> ↓  
> 选择一个你可以与长期志同道合的人一起玩的行业。  
> ↓  
> 互联网大大拓宽了职业的可能空间。大多数人还没有意识到这一点。  
> ↓  
> 玩重复的游戏。人生中的所有回报，无论是财富、人际关系还是知识，都是来自复利的作用。  
> ↓  
> 选择商业伙伴时，要选择高智商、有活力，最重要的是有诚信的人。  
> ↓  
> 不要与愤世嫉俗者和悲观主义者合作。他们的信念会自我实现。  
> ↓  
> 学会销售，学会创造。如果你两者都会，你将无可阻挡。  
> ↓  
> 以具体的知识、责任感和杠杆武装自己。  
> ↓  
> 具体知识是你无法通过训练获得的知识。如果社会能训练你，它也可以训练其他人并取代你。  
> ↓  
> 具体知识来自于追求你真正的好奇心和热情，而不是当下热门的事物。  
> ↓  
> 建立具体知识对你来说会像玩乐一样，而在别人看来却像工作。  
> ↓  
> 具体知识的传授是通过学徒制，而不是学校。  
> ↓  
> 具体知识通常是高度技术性或富有创造性的，无法被外包或自动化。  
> ↓  
> 拥抱责任感，以你自己的名义承担商业风险。社会会以责任、股权和杠杆奖励你。  
> ↓  
> “给我一个足够长的杠杆和一个支点，我就能撬动地球。” —阿基米德  
> ↓  
> 财富需要杠杆。商业杠杆来自资本、人力和无复制边际成本的产品（如代码和媒体）。  
> ↓  
> 资本意味着金钱。要筹集资金，应用你的具体知识，承担责任，并展示良好的判断力。  
> ↓  
> 劳动力意味着为你工作的人。这是最古老、最激烈争夺的杠杆形式。劳动力杠杆会让你的父母印象深刻，但不要浪费你的生命追逐它。  
> ↓  
> 资本和劳动力是需要许可的杠杆。每个人都在追逐资本，但有人必须把资本给你。每个人都想领导，但有人必须追随你。  
> ↓  
> 代码和媒体是无需许可的杠杆。它们是新富阶层背后的杠杆。你可以创造软件和媒体，让它们在你睡觉时为你工作。  
> ↓  
> 一个机器人大军已经可以自由使用——它们被打包在数据中心中以提高热量和空间效率。使用它吧。  
> ↓  
> 如果你不会编程，就写书、写博客，录制视频和播客。  
> ↓  
> 杠杆是判断力的倍增器。  
> ↓  
> 判断力需要经验，但可以通过学习基础技能更快地建立。  
> ↓  
> 没有“商业”这门技能。避免商业杂志和商业课程。  
> ↓  
> 学习微观经济学、博弈论、心理学、说服学、伦理学、数学和计算机。  
> ↓  
> 阅读比听更快，做比看更快。  
> ↓  
> 你应该忙得没时间“喝咖啡”，同时保持简洁的日程表。  
> ↓  
> 设置并执行一个理想的个人时薪。如果解决某个问题节省的时间比你的时薪少，就忽略它。如果外包某项任务的成本低于你的时薪，就外包它。  
> ↓  
> 尽你所能努力工作，尽管与谁一起工作以及工作内容比努力工作本身更重要。  
> ↓  
> 成为世界上最擅长你所做事情的人，持续重新定义你所做的事情，直到这成为现实。  
> ↓  
> 没有快速致富的计划。那些只是其他人通过你致富的手段。  
> ↓  
> 运用具体知识，加上杠杆，最终你会得到你应得的东西。  
> ↓  
> 当你终于富有时，你会意识到这并不是你最初在追求的东西，但那是另一回事了。[11]

> 总结：把自己产品化

**你的总结说“把自己产品化”——这是什么意思？**

“产品化”和“你自己”。“你自己”具有独特性，“产品化”具有杠杆性。“你自己”有责任感，“产品化”具有具体知识。“你自己”也包含具体知识。所以你可以把所有这些要素组合到这两个词中。

如果你正朝着长期致富的目标前进，你应该问自己：“这对我来说是否真实？这是不是我自己在投射？”然后，“我是否在产品化它？我是否在扩展它？我是通过劳动力、资本、代码还是媒体进行扩展？”所以这是一个非常简便、有用的助记符。[78]

这很难。这就是为什么我说这需要几十年——我不是说执行需要几十年，而是可能需要更好的十年去弄清楚你能独特提供的是什么。[10]

**财富和金钱的区别是什么？**

金钱是我们转移财富的方式。金钱是社会的信用。它是一种有能力拥有其他人时间的借贷方式。

如果我做好了我的工作，如果我为社会创造了价值，社会会说：“哦，谢谢你。我们欠你一些未来的东西，以补偿你在过去做的工作。给你一张小小的借据，我们称之为金钱。”[78]

财富是你真正想要的东西。财富是在你睡觉时也能赚钱的资产。财富是工厂，是机器人，在不停地生产东西。财富是夜间运行的计算机程序，服务其他客户。财富甚至是存银行的钱，被再投资到其他资产和其他业务中。

甚至一所房子也可以是财富的一种形式，因为你可以将其出租，尽管这可能是比某些商业用途更低效的土地利用方式。

所以，我对财富的定义更多是那些在你睡觉时也能赚取收益的企业和资产。[78]

> 科技使消费民主化，但生产集中化。世界上最擅长做某件事的人可以为所有人做这件事。

社会会为你创造它想要的东西付钱。但社会尚不知道如何创造这些东西，因为如果他们知道，他们就不需要你了。这些东西已经被批量生产出来了。

你家里、工作场所和街道上的几乎所有东西在某个时间点都曾是技术。有一段时间，石油是一项技术，使J.D.洛克菲勒变得富有。有一段时间，汽车是一项技术，使亨利·福特变得富有。

因此，技术是一组事物，正如艾伦·凯所说的那些还不完全奏效的东西（更正：丹尼·希利斯）。一旦某个东西奏效了，它就不再是技术。社会总是想要新事物。而如果你想变得富有，你需要弄清楚你能为社会提供哪些他们尚不知道如何获得但会想要的东西，并且提供这些东西对你来说是自然而然的，符合你的技能和能力。

然后，你需要弄清楚如何扩展它，因为如果你只建造一个，那是不够的。你得建造成千上万个、数百万个、甚至数十亿个，让每个人都能拥有一个。史蒂夫·乔布斯（当然还有他的团队）发现社会会想要智能手机。一个口袋里的电脑，具备电话的一百倍功能，并且易于使用。所以他们找出了如何建造它，然后找出了如何扩展它。[78]
