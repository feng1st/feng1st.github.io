### Find a Position of Leverage

We live in an age of infinite leverage, and the economic rewards for genuine intellectual curiosity have never been higher. [11] Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now. [11]

Knowledge only you know or only a small set of people knows is going to come out of your passions and your hobbies, oddly enough. If you have hobbies around your intellectual curiosity, you’re more likely to develop these passions. [1]

> If it entertains you now but will bore you someday, it’s a distraction. Keep looking.

I only really want to do things for their own sake. That is one definition of art. Whether it’s business, exercise, romance, friendship, whatever, I think the meaning of life is to do things for their own sake. Ironically, when you do things for their own sake, you create your best work. Even if you’re just trying to make money, you will actually be the most successful.

The year I generated the most wealth for myself was actually the year I worked the least hard and cared the least about the future. I was mostly doing things for the sheer fun of it. I was basically telling people, “I’m retired, I’m not working.” Then, I had the time for whatever was my highest valued project in front of me. By doing things for their own sake, I did them at their best. [74]

The less you want something, the less you’re thinking about it, the less you’re obsessing over it, the more you’re going to do it in a natural way. The more you’re going to do it for yourself. You’re going to do it in a way you’re good at, and you’re going to stick with it. The people around you will see the quality of your work is higher. [1]

Follow your intellectual curiosity more than whatever is “hot” right now. If your curiosity ever leads you to a place where society eventually wants to go, you’ll get paid extremely well. [3]

You’re more likely to have skills society does not yet know how to train other people to do. If someone can train other people how to do something, then they can replace you. If they can replace you, then they don’t have to pay you a lot. You want to know how to do something other people don’t know how to do at the time period when those skills are in demand. [1]

> If they can train you to do it, then eventually they will train a computer to do it.

You get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and doesn’t know how to get elsewhere. A lot of people think you can go to school and study for how to make money, but the reality is, there’s no skill called “business.” [1]

Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale. That is really the challenge of how to make money.

> Now, the problem is becoming good at whatever “it” is. It moves around from generation to generation, but a lot of it happens to be in technology.

You are waiting for your moment when something emerges in the world, they need a skill set, and you’re uniquely qualified. You build your brand in the meantime on Twitter, on YouTube, and by giving away free work. You make a name for yourself, and you take some risk in the process. When it is time to move on the opportunity, you can do so with leverage—the maximum leverage possible. [1]

There are three broad classes of leverage:

**One form of leverage is labor**—other humans working for you. It is the oldest form of leverage, and actually not a great one in the modern world. [1] I would argue this is the worst form of leverage that you could possibly use. Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills. You’re one short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten or torn apart by the mob. [78]

**Money is good as a form of leverage.** It means every time you make a decision, you multiply it with money. [1] Capital is a trickier form of leverage to use. It’s more modern. It’s the one that people have used to get fabulously wealthy in the last century. It’s probably been the dominant form of leverage in the last century.

You can see this by looking for the richest people. It’s bankers, politicians in corrupt countries who print money, essentially people who move large amounts of money around. If you look at the top of very large companies, outside of technology companies, in many, many large old companies, the CEO job is really a financial job.

It scales very, very well. If you get good at managing capital, you can manage more and more capital much more easily than you can manage more and more people. [78]

The final form of leverage is brand new—the most democratic form. It is: **“products with no marginal cost of replication.”**

This includes books, media, movies, and code. Code is probably the most powerful form of permissionless leverage. All you need is a computer—you don’t need anyone’s permission. [1]

> Forget rich versus poor, white-collar versus blue. It’s now leveraged versus un-leveraged.

The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is the idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of leverage. This was only invented in the last few hundred years. It started with the printing press. It accelerated with broadcast media, and now it’s really blown up with the internet and with coding. Now, you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.

This book is a form of leverage. Long ago, I would have had to sit in a lecture hall and lecture each of you personally. I would have maybe reached a few hundred people, and that would have been that. [78]

This newest form of leverage is where all the new fortunes are made, all the new billionaires. For the last generation, fortunes were made by capital. The people who made fortunes were the Warren Buffetts of the world.

But the new generation’s fortunes are all made through code or media. Joe Rogan making $50 million to $100 million a year from his podcast. You’re going to have PewDiePie. I don’t know how much money he’s rolling in, but he’s bigger than the news. And of course, there’s Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs. Their wealth is all code-based leverage. [78]

Probably the most interesting thing to keep in mind about new forms of leverage is they are permissionless. They don’t require somebody else’s permission for you to use them or succeed. For labor leverage, somebody has to decide to follow you. For capital leverage, somebody has to give you money to invest or to turn into a product.

Coding, writing books, recording podcasts, tweeting, YouTubing—these kinds of things are permissionless. You don’t need anyone’s permission to do them, and that’s why they are very egalitarian. They’re great equalizers of leverage. [78] Every great software developer, for example, now has an army of robots working for him at nighttime while he or she sleeps, after they’ve written the code, and it’s cranking away. [78]

> You’re never going to get rich renting out your time.

Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you’re accountable on your output, as opposed to your input—that’s the dream. [10]

Humans evolved in societies where there was no leverage. If I was chopping wood or carrying water for you, you knew eight hours put in would be equal to about eight hours of output. Now we’ve invented leverage—through capital, cooperation, technology, productivity, all these means. We live in an age of leverage. As a worker, you want to be as leveraged as possible so you have a huge impact without as much time or physical effort.

A leveraged worker can out-produce a non-leveraged worker by a factor of one thousand or ten thousand. With a leveraged worker, judgment is far more important than how much time they put in or how hard they work.

> Forget 10x programmers. 1,000x programmers really exist, we just don’t fully acknowledge it. See @ID_AA_Carmack, @notch, Satoshi Nakomoto, etc.

For example, a good software engineer, just by writing the right little piece of code and creating the right little application, can literally create half a billion dollars’ worth of value for a company. But ten engineers working ten times as hard, just because they choose the wrong model, the wrong product, wrote it the wrong way, or put in the wrong viral loop, have basically wasted their time. Inputs don’t match outputs, especially for leveraged workers.

What you want in life is to be in control of your time. You want to get into a leveraged job where you control your own time and you’re tracked on the outputs. If you do something incredible to move the needle on the business, they have to pay you. Especially if they don’t know how you did it because it’s innate to your obsession or your skill or your innate abilities, they’re going to have to keep paying you to do it.

If you have specific knowledge, you have accountability and you have leverage; they have to pay you what you’re worth. If they pay you what you’re worth, then you can get your time back—you can be hyper-efficient. You’re not doing meetings for meetings’ sake, you’re not trying to impress other people, you’re not writing things down to make it look like you did work. All you care about is the actual work itself.

When you do just the actual work itself, you’ll be far more productive, far more efficient. You’ll work when you feel like it—when you’re high-energy—and you won’t be trying to struggle through when you’re low energy. You’ll gain your time back.

> Forty hour work weeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes—train and sprint, then rest and reassess.

Sales is an example—especially very high-end sales. If you’re a real estate agent out there selling houses, it’s not a great job, necessarily. It’s very crowded. But if you’re a top-tier real estate agent, you know how to market yourself and you know how to sell houses, it’s possible you could sell $5 million mansions in one tenth of the time while somebody else is struggling to sell $100,000 apartments or condos. Real estate agent is a job with input and output disconnected.

Building any product and selling any product fits this description. And fundamentally, what else is there? Where you don’t necessarily want to be is a support role, like customer service. In customer service, unfortunately, inputs and outputs relate relatively close to each other, and the hours you put in matter. [10]

Tools and leverage create this disconnection between inputs and outputs. The higher the creativity component of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs. If you’re looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it’s going to be very hard to create wealth and make wealth for yourself in that process. [78]

> If you want to be part of a great tech company, then you need to be able to SELL or BUILD. If you don’t do either, learn.

Learn to sell, learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

These are two very broad categories. One is building the product. This is hard, and it’s multivariate. It can include design; it can include development; it can include manufacturing, logistics, procurement; and it can even be designing and operating a service. It has many, many definitions.

But in every industry, there is a definition of the builder. In our tech industry, it’s the CTO, it’s the programmer, it’s the software engineer or hardware engineer. But even in the laundry business, it could be the person who’s building the laundry service, who is making the trains run on time, who’s making sure all the clothes end up in the right place at the right time, and so on.

The other side of it is sales. Again, selling has a very broad definition. Selling doesn’t necessarily just mean selling to individual customers, but it can mean marketing, it can mean communicating, it can mean recruiting, it can mean raising money, it can mean inspiring people, it could mean doing PR. It’s a broad umbrella category. [78]

> Earn with your mind, not your time.

Let’s talk more about the real estate business. The worst kind of job is someone who’s doing labor to repair a house. Maybe you get paid ten dollars or twenty dollars an hour. You go to people’s houses, your boss demands you’re there at 8:00 a.m., and you repair your piece of the house. Here, you have zero leverage. You have some accountability, but not really, because your accountability is to your boss, not to the client. You don’t have any real specific knowledge, since what you’re doing is labor lots of people can do. You’re not going to get paid a lot. You’re getting paid minimum wage plus a little bit for your skill and your time.

The next level up might be the general contractor working on the house for the owner. They may be getting paid $50,000 to do the whole project, then they’re paying the labor fifteen dollars an hour and they’re keeping the difference.

A general contractor is obviously a better place to be. But how do we measure it? How do we know it’s better? Well, we know it’s better because this person has some accountability. They’re responsible for the outcome, they have to sweat at night if things aren’t working. Contractors have leverage through laborers working for them. They also have little bit more specific knowledge: how to organize a team, make them show up on time, and how to deal with city regulations.

The next level up might be a real estate developer. A developer is someone who’s going to buy a property, hire a bunch of contractors, and transform it into something higher value. They probably have to take out a loan to buy a house or go to investors to raise money. They buy the old house, tear it down, rebuild it, and sell it. Instead of $50,000 like the general contractor, or fifteen dollars an hour like the laborer, the developer might be able to make a million dollars or half a million dollars in profit when they sell the house for more than they bought it for, including the expenses of construction. But now, notice what is required from the developer: a very high level of accountability.

The developer takes on more risk, more accountability, has more leverage, and needs to have more specific knowledge. They need to understand fundraising, city regulations, where the real estate market is headed, and whether they should take the risk or not. It is more difficult.

The next level up might be someone who’s managing money in a real estate fund. They have an enormous amount of capital leverage. They’re dealing with lots and lots of developers, and they’re buying huge amounts of housing inventory. [74]

One level beyond that might be somebody who says, “Actually, I want to bring the maximum leverage to bear in this market and the maximum specific knowledge.” That person would say, “Well, I understand real estate, and I understand everything from basic housing construction, to building properties and selling them, to how real estate markets move and thrive, and I also understand the technology business. I understand how to recruit developers, how to write code, and how to build a good product, and I understand how to raise money from venture capitalists, how to return it, and how all of that works.”

Obviously, not a single person may know this. You may pull a team together to do it where each have different skill sets, but that combined entity would have specific knowledge in technology and in real estate. It would have massive accountability because that company’s name would be a very high-risk, high-reward effort attached to the whole thing, and people would devote their lives to it and take on significant risk. It would have leverage in code with lots of developers. It would have capital with investors putting money in and the founder’s own capital. It would have some of the highest-quality labor you can find, which is high-quality engineers, designers, and marketers who are working on the company.

Then, you may end up with a Trulia, Redfin, or Zillow company, and then the upside could potentially be in the billions of dollars, or the hundreds of millions of dollars. [78]

Each level has increasing leverage, increasing accountability, increasingly specific knowledge. You’re adding in money-based leverage on top of labor-based leverage. Adding in code-based leverage on top of money and labor allows you to actually create something bigger and bigger and get closer and closer to owning all the upside, not just being paid a salary.

You start as a salaried employee. But you want to work your way up to try and get higher leverage, more accountability, and specific knowledge. The combination of those over a long period of time with the magic of compound interest will make you wealthy. [74]

The one thing you have to avoid is the risk of ruin.

Avoiding ruin means stay out of jail. So, don’t do anything illegal. It’s never worth it to wear an orange jumpsuit. Stay out of total catastrophic loss. Avoiding ruin could also mean you stay out of things that could be physically dangerous or hurt your body. You have to watch your health.

Stay out of things that could cause you to lose all of your capital, all of your savings. Don’t gamble everything on one go. Instead, take rationally optimistic bets with big upsides. [78]

### 找到一个杠杆点

我们生活在一个无限杠杆的时代，对真正的知识好奇心的经济回报从未如此之高。[11] 追随你真正的知识好奇心，比追随当下赚钱的事物更适合作为职业的基础。[11]

知识——那些只有你知道或只有一小部分人知道的知识——奇怪的是，它往往来自你的激情和爱好。如果你围绕着自己的知识好奇心培养爱好，你就更有可能发展出这些激情。[1]

> 如果现在让你觉得有趣但将来会让你感到无聊，那就是一种干扰。继续寻找下去。

我只想做那些纯粹为了自己的事情。这是艺术的一个定义。无论是商业、运动、浪漫、友谊，还是其他什么，我认为生活的意义就在于为了自己的缘故去做事情。讽刺的是，当你为了自己的缘故去做某件事时，你会创造出最好的作品。即使你只是为了赚钱，你实际上也会最成功。

我自己创造最多财富的那一年，实际上是我最不努力工作、最不在意未来的一年。我大部分时间都在为了纯粹的乐趣做事。我基本上告诉别人，“我退休了，我不工作了”。于是，我有时间去处理我面前最高价值的项目。正因为是为了事情本身去做，我做到了最好。[74]

你越不想要某样东西，越不去想着它，越不为它着迷，你就越可能以自然的方式去做它。你会更多地为了自己去做。你会用擅长的方式去做，并且坚持下去。你周围的人会看到你的作品质量更高。[1]

追随你的知识好奇心，而不是追随当前的“热点”。如果你的好奇心最终把你带到了一个社会最终想要去的地方，你会获得非常丰厚的报酬。[3]

你更有可能掌握社会尚未知道如何训练他人去做的技能。如果有人能够教别人做某事，那他们就可以替代你。如果他们可以替代你，那他们就不必给你高薪。你要知道如何在这些技能需求高的时间段内，去做别人不知道如何做的事情。[1]

> 如果他们能训练你去做某件事，那么最终他们也会训练计算机去做。

社会会因为你提供它想要而别处无法获得的东西而奖励你。很多人认为可以通过上学来学习如何赚钱，但实际上并没有所谓的“商业”这种技能。[1]

想想社会想要什么产品或服务，但还不知道如何获得。你想成为那个能够交付它并且规模化交付的人。这才是赚钱的真正挑战。

> 现在的问题是变得擅长那个“它”是什么。它随着世代而变化，但很多都与科技有关。

你要等待你的一刻，当世界上出现某些需求时，他们需要某种技能，而你恰好有独特的资质。在这段时间里，你可以通过Twitter、YouTube、免费提供作品来建立自己的品牌。你要建立自己的声誉，同时也要承担一定的风险。当机会来临时，你可以用最大杠杆行动。[1]

有三种广泛的杠杆类型：

**一种杠杆形式是劳动力**——也就是别人为你工作。这是最古老的杠杆形式，在现代世界其实并不是一个很好的杠杆形式。[1] 我认为这是你能使用的最糟糕的杠杆形式。管理别人非常混乱，需要巨大的领导能力。你只差一步就会发生叛变，或者被群众撕裂或吃掉。[78]

**金钱是另一种杠杆形式**。它意味着每次你做出决策时，你都可以用金钱去放大它。[1] 资本是更难使用的杠杆形式。它更现代，是过去一个世纪人们用来致富的一种杠杆形式。它可能是上个世纪最主要的杠杆形式。

你可以通过观察最富有的人看到这一点。银行家、在腐败国家印钱的政客，基本上是那些在管理大量资金的人。如果你看看一些非常大的公司，尤其是非科技公司，许多大公司的CEO的工作实际上是一个金融工作。

资本的杠杆扩展性非常强。如果你擅长管理资本，你可以更轻松地管理越来越多的资本，比管理更多人要容易得多。[78]

最后一种杠杆形式是全新的——最民主化的形式。它就是：**“复制成本为零的产品”**。

这包括书籍、媒体、电影和代码。代码可能是最强大的无许可杠杆形式。你所需要的只是电脑——你不需要任何人的许可。[1]

> 忘掉富人和穷人，白领和蓝领。现在是杠杆者与非杠杆者的对立。

最有趣和最重要的杠杆形式是没有边际复制成本的产品的概念。这是新的杠杆形式。它只是在过去几百年才被发明出来的。它从印刷机开始，加速于广播媒体，现在随着互联网和编程的普及真正爆发。如今，你可以放大你的努力，而不需要其他人的参与，也不需要其他人的资金。

这本书就是一种杠杆形式。很久以前，我可能不得不在一个讲堂里对每一个人亲自讲授，我可能只能接触到几百人，这就是极限了。[78]

这种最新的杠杆形式是所有新财富产生的地方，是所有新亿万富翁产生的地方。上一代人通过资本致富。那些财富制造者是像沃伦·巴菲特这样的世界级投资者。

而新一代的财富则通过代码或媒体来产生。乔·罗根每年通过他的播客赚取五千万到一亿美元。你会看到PewDiePie（油管知名博主），我不知道他赚了多少钱，但他比新闻媒体还大。当然还有杰夫·贝佐斯、马克·扎克伯格、拉里·佩奇、谢尔盖·布林、比尔·盖茨和史蒂夫·乔布斯。他们的财富都是基于代码的杠杆。[78]

关于新型杠杆最有趣的事情是它们是无许可的。你不需要其他人的许可来使用它们或成功。劳动力杠杆需要别人决定追随你。资本杠杆需要别人给你钱去投资或转化为产品。

编程、写书、录制播客、发推特、做YouTube视频——这些都是无许可的事情。你不需要别人的许可去做这些事情，这也是它们非常平等的原因。它们是杠杆的伟大平衡器。[78] 比如，一个伟大的软件开发人员在他或她睡觉的时候，有一支机器人军队在为他们工作，因为他们写下了代码，而代码在不停地运行。[78]

> 靠出租时间你永远不会富有。

在生活中，无论何时，只要可能，都要优化独立性，而不是收入。如果你有独立性，并且对自己的产出负责，而不是输入——这就是梦想。[10]

人类是在没有杠杆的社会中进化的。如果我为你砍柴或挑水，你知道投入的八个小时大约等于八小时的产出。而现在，我们发明了杠杆——通过资本、合作、技术、生产力等各种方式。我们生活在杠杆的时代。作为一个工人，你希望自己有尽可能多的杠杆，以便在不需要那么多时间或体力的情况下产生巨大的影响。

一个有杠杆的工人可以比一个没有杠杆的工人多出一千倍甚至一万倍的生产力。对有杠杆的工人来说，判断力远比他们投入多少时间或工作多努力更重要。

> 忘掉10倍程序员吧。1000倍程序员是真实存在的，我们只是没有完全承认它。见@ID_AA_Carmack，@notch，Satoshi Nakomoto等人。

例如，一个好的软件工程师，仅仅通过写对的一小段代码并创建正确的小应用程序，就可以为公司创造出五亿美元的价值。但十个工程师工作十倍辛苦，如果他们选择了错误的模型、错误的产品、用错误的方式编写或加入了错误的病毒传播环节，那么他们基本上是在浪费时间。投入和产出对于有杠杆的工人来说并不匹配。

生活中你要想掌控时间。你要进入一个杠杆化的工作，你可以控制自己的时间，且工作成果可衡量。如果你做了一件事极大地推动了业务的发展，他们必须得付你报酬。尤其是如果他们不知道你是怎么做到的，因为这是源于你的痴迷或技能或与生俱来的能力，那么他们就必须持续付钱给你，让你继续做下去。

如果你有具体的知识，有责任感并且有杠杆，他们就必须支付你应得的报酬。如果他们支付你应得的报酬，那么你就可以拿回自己的时间——你可以变得超级高效。你不会为了开会而开会，不会为了给别人留下深刻印象而做事，不会为了看起来工作而去写东西。你只关心实际的工作本身。

当你只做实际工作本身时，你会变得更加高效、更加富有成效。你会在你觉得有状态时工作——当你精力充沛时——而不是在你低能量时挣扎着工作。你会把自己的时间夺回来。

> 每周四十小时的工作是工业时代的遗迹。知识工作者如同运动员——训练和冲刺，然后休息和反思。

销售是一个例子——尤其是非常高端的销售。如果你是一个房地产中介，在外面卖房子，那不一定是个好工作。竞争很激烈。但是如果你是顶级的房地产中介，懂得如何推销自己，懂得如何卖房子，你有可能在其他人挣扎着出售十万美元的公寓或公寓时，花十分之一的时间卖掉五百万美元的豪宅。房地产中介的工作就是投入和产出脱钩的例子。

制造任何产品和销售任何产品都符合这种描述。并且，根本上说，还有什么不是这样呢？你不希望去的地方是支持性岗位，比如客户服务。不幸的是，在客户服务中，投入和产出相对较为紧密相关，你所投入的小时数很重要。[10]

工具和杠杆创造了投入和产出之间的这种脱钩。一个职业的创造性成分越高，投入和产出的脱钩就越可能。如果你从事的职业中投入和产出高度关联，那么在这个过程中创造财富并致富会非常困难。[78]

> 如果你想成为一家伟大的科技公司的一部分，那么你需要能够“销售”或“构建”。如果你两者都不做，那就去学。

学会销售，学会构建。如果你两者都会，你将不可阻挡。

这是两个非常广泛的类别。一个是构建产品。这是困难的，而且是多变量的。它可能包括设计；它可能包括开发；它可能包括制造、物流、采购；甚至是设计和运营服务。它有许多定义。

但在每个行业中，都有“构建者”的定义。在我们的科技行业中，它是首席技术官，它是程序员，它是软件工程师或硬件工程师。但即使是在洗衣业务中，也可以是那个构建洗衣服务的人，是那个确保所有衣服在正确时间出现在正确地方的人，等等。

另一方面是销售。销售也有非常广泛的定义。销售并不一定只是指向个人客户销售，但它可以是营销、传播、招聘、筹资、激励人们、做公关。这是一个广义的总称。[78]

> 用你的头脑赚钱，而不是你的时间。

让我们再谈谈房地产业务。最糟糕的工作是修理房子的劳动者。也许你每小时赚十美元或二十美元。你去人们家里，你的老板要求你早上8点到那里，你修理房子的某一部分。这里，你几乎没有杠杆。你有一些责任，但不是真正的责任，因为你的责任是对老板而不是客户。你没有真正的具体知识，因为你做的工作是很多人都能做的。你不会得到高薪。你只能拿到最低工资再加上你的一点技能和时间。

再上一个层次可能是为房主工作的总承包商。他们可能赚取五万美元来完成整个项目，然后支付工人每小时十五美元，并保留差额。

总承包商显然是一个更好的位置。但我们如何衡量呢？我们怎么知道它更好？我们知道它更好是因为这个人有一定的责任。他们对结果负责，如果事情不顺利他们需要夜不能寐。承包商通过为他们工作的工人获得杠杆。他们还有一点更具体的知识：如何组织团队，让他们按时到达，以及如何处理城市规定。

再上一个层次可能是房地产开发商。开发商是要购买一处房产，雇用一群承包商，将其转化为更高价值的东西。他们可能需要贷款买房，或者去找投资者筹集资金。他们买下旧房子，把它拆掉，重建，卖掉。不同于总承包商赚取的五万美元或工人的每小时十五美元，开发商在扣除建筑费用后，可能能够通过更高价出售房子获得一百万或五十万美元的利润。但现在，注意开发商需要什么：非常高的责任。

开发商承担了更多的风险，更多的责任，拥有更多的杠杆，并且需要有更多的具体知识。他们需要了解融资、城市规定、房地产市场的走向以及是否应该承担风险。这更为困难。

再上一个层次可能是管理房地产基金的某个人。他们有巨额资本杠杆。他们在与很多开发商打交道，购买大量的住房库存。[74]

再上一个层次可能是某个人说，“实际上，我想在这个市场中施加最大的杠杆并且具有最强的具体知识。”这个人可能会说，“我了解房地产，从基础的住房建设，到房产开发和销售，再到房地产市场如何运行，我还了解科技业务。我知道如何招募开发人员，如何写代码，如何构建一个好的产品，还知道如何从风投公司筹集资金，如何回报资金，以及所有这一切是如何运作的。”

显然，不可能是一个人了解所有这些。你可能会组成一个团队，每个人都有不同的技能，但结合在一起的团队会在科技和房地产方面拥有具体的知识。它会拥有巨大的责任感，因为这个公司的名字与整个项目的高风险和高回报联系在一起，人们会全身心投入并承担显著的风险。它会有代码杠杆，带有很多开发人员。它会有资本杠杆，投资者出资和创始人自己的资本。它会有最高质量的劳动力，那些高素质的工程师、设计师和市场人员在为公司工作。

然后，你可能会得到类似Trulia、Redfin或Zillow这样的公司，最终的上升空间可能是数十亿美元，或数亿美元。[78]

每个层次都有越来越多的杠杆，越来越多的责任，越来越具体的知识。你在劳动杠杆之上添加了资金杠杆。在资金和劳动之上添加了代码杠杆，实际上使你可以创建更大规模的东西，并且越来越接近拥有所有的上升空间，而不仅仅是领取工资。

你从一个拿工资的员工开始。但你要努力向上，尝试获得更高的杠杆，更多的责任和具体的知识。经过长时间的积累，结合复利的魔力，这些将使你变得富有。[74]

你唯一必须避免的事情是破产的风险。

避免破产意味着远离监狱。因此，不要做任何非法的事情。穿橙色囚衣是永远不值得的。远离彻底的灾难性损失。避免破产也意味着你要远离那些可能对身体有危险或损害健康的事情。你必须关注健康。

避免那些可能导致你失去所有资本、所有积蓄的事情。不要将所有赌注压在一次机会之上。相反，进行理性乐观的赌注，选择有很大上升空间的赌注。[78]
