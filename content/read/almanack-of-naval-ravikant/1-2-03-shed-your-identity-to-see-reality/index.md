### Shed Your Identity to See Reality

Our egos are constructed in our formative years—our first two decades. They get constructed by our environment, our parents, society. Then, we spend the rest of our life trying to make our ego happy. We interpret anything new through our ego: “How do I change the external world to make it more how I would like it to be?” [8]

You absolutely need habits to function. You cannot solve every problem in life as if it is the first time it’s thrown at you. We accumulate all these habits. We put them in the bundle of identity, ego, ourselves, and then we get attached to them. “I’m Naval. This is the way I am.”

It’s really important to be able to uncondition yourself, to be able to take your habits apart and say, “Okay, this is a habit I probably picked up when I was a toddler trying to get my parent’s attention. Now I’ve reinforced it and reinforced it, and I call it a part of my identity. Does it still serve me? Does it make me happier? Does it make me healthier? Does it make me accomplish whatever I set out to accomplish?”

I’m less habitual than most people. I don’t like to structure my day. To the extent I have habits, I try to make them more deliberate rather than accidents of history. [4]

> Any belief you took in a package (ex. Democrat, Catholic, American) is suspect and should be re-evaluated from base principles.

I try not to have too much I’ve pre-decided. I think creating identities and labels locks you in and keeps you from seeing the truth.

> To be honest, speak without identity.

I used to identify as libertarian, but then I would find myself defending positions I hadn’t really thought through because they’re a part of the libertarian canon. If all your beliefs line up into neat little bundles, you should be highly suspicious.

I don’t like to self-identify on almost any level anymore, which keeps me from having too many of these so-called stable beliefs. [4]

> We each have a contrarian belief society rejects. But the more our own identity and local tribe reject it, the more real it likely is.

There are two attractive lessons about suffering in the long term. It can make you accept the world the way it is. The other lesson is it can make your ego change in an extremely hard way.

Maybe you’re a competitive athlete, and you get injured badly, like Bruce Lee. You have to accept being an athlete is not your entire identity, and maybe you can forge a new identity as a philosopher. [8]

### 摆脱身份以看清现实

我们的自我在形成的年岁中构建——也就是头二十年。它们被我们的环境、父母和社会所构建。然后，我们用余生试图让我们的自我感到满足。我们通过自我来解读所有的新事物：“我该如何改变外部世界，使其更符合我的期望？” [8]

> “紧张是你认为你应该成为的样子。放松是你真正的样子。”  
> ——佛教谚语

你绝对需要习惯来维持运转。你不能每次遇到问题都像第一次遇到一样去解决。我们积累了所有这些习惯，并将它们归于身份、自我和自我认知之中，然后我们就开始执着于它们。“我是纳瓦尔。这就是我的样子。”

能够去条件化自己是非常重要的，能够把你的习惯拆开并说：“好吧，这可能是我小时候为了得到父母的注意而养成的习惯。现在我不断强化它，并把它视作我身份的一部分。它现在还对我有用吗？它让我更快乐吗？它让我更健康吗？它能让我达成我想要达成的目标吗？”

与大多数人相比，我的习惯较少。我不喜欢给我的一天设置太多结构。到我有一些习惯的程度，我试图让它们更加有意识，而不是历史的偶然产物。[4]

> 任何成套接受的信仰（例如：民主党、天主教、美国人）都应受到质疑，并应从基础原则重新评估。

我尽量不让自己过于预先决定太多事情。我认为创造身份和标签会将你锁定，并阻止你看到真相。

> 说真话时，不带身份。

我曾经自认为是自由意志主义者，但后来我发现自己在捍卫一些我并未真正深思过的立场，只是因为它们是自由意志主义的典范。如果你所有的信仰都能整齐地排成一小堆，你就应该对它们抱有高度怀疑。

我不喜欢在任何层面上对自我进行过多的定义，这样可以避免让我拥有过多所谓的稳定信仰。[4]

> 我们每个人都有一个被社会拒绝的反叛信念。但越是被我们自己的身份和地方部落所拒绝，这个信念可能越接近真实。

关于长期受苦，有两个有吸引力的教训。它可以让你接受世界原本的样子。另一个教训是，它可以让你的自我以极其艰难的方式改变。

也许你是一名竞技运动员，但你受了重伤，比如李小龙。你必须接受做运动员并不是你身份的全部，也许你可以锻造一个作为哲学家的新身份。[8]

> Facebook重新设计了。Twitter重新设计了。人格、职业和团队也需要重新设计。在一个动态系统中，没有永久的解决方案。
