### How to Think Clearly

> “Clear thinker” is a better compliment than “smart.”

Real knowledge is intrinsic, and it’s built from the ground up. To use a math example, you can’t understand trigonometry without understanding arithmetic and geometry. Basically, if someone is using a lot of fancy words and a lot of big concepts, they probably don’t know what they’re talking about. I think the smartest people can explain things to a child. If you can’t explain it to a child, then you don’t know it. It’s a common saying and it’s very true.

Richard Feynman very famously does this in “Six Easy Pieces,” one of his early physics lectures. He basically explains mathematics in three pages. He starts from the number line— counting—and then he goes all the way up to precalculus. He just builds it up through an unbroken chain of logic. He doesn’t rely on any definitions.

The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. They understand the basics at a very, very fundamental level. I would rather understand the basics really well than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts I can’t stitch together and can’t rederive from the basics. If you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you’re lost. You’re just memorizing. [4]

The advanced concepts in a field are less proven. We use them to signal insider knowledge, but we’d be better off nailing the basics. [11]

> Clear thinkers appeal to their own authority.

**Part of making effective decisions boils down to dealing with reality. How do you make sure you’re dealing with reality when you’re making decisions?**

By not having a strong sense of self or judgments or mind presence. The “monkey mind” will always respond with this regurgitated emotional response to what it thinks the world should be. Those desires will cloud your reality. This happens a lot of times when people are mixing politics and business.

The number one thing clouding us from being able to see reality is we have preconceived notions of the way it should be.

One definition of a moment of suffering is “the moment when you see things exactly the way they are.” This whole time, you’ve been convinced your business is doing great, and really, you’ve ignored the signs it’s not doing well. Then, your business fails, and you suffer because you’ve been putting off reality. You’ve been hiding it from yourself.

The good news is, the moment of suffering—when you’re in pain—is a moment of truth. It is a moment where you’re forced to embrace reality the way it actually is. Then, you can make meaningful change and progress. You can only make progress when you’re starting with the truth.

The hard thing is seeing the truth. To see the truth, you have to get your ego out of the way because your ego doesn’t want to face the truth. The smaller you can make your ego, the less conditioned you can make your reactions, the less desires you can have about the outcome you want, the easier it will be to see the reality.

> What we wish to be true clouds our perception of what is true. Suffering is the moment when we can no longer deny reality.

Imagine we’re going through something difficult like a breakup, a job loss, a business failure, or a health problem, and our friends are advising us. When we’re advising them, the answer is obvious. It comes to us in a minute, and we tell them exactly, “Oh that girl, get over her, she wasn’t good for you anyway. You’ll be happier. Trust me. You’ll find someone.”

You know the correct answer, but your friend can’t see it, because they’re in the moment of suffering and pain. They’re still wishing reality was different. The problem isn’t reality. The problem is their desire is colliding with reality and preventing them from seeing the truth, no matter how much you say it. The same thing happens when I make decisions.

The more desire I have for something to work out a certain way, the less likely I am to see the truth. Especially in business, if something isn’t going well, I try to acknowledge it publicly and I try to acknowledge it publicly in front of my co-founders and friends and co-workers. Then, I’m not hiding it from anybody else. If I’m not hiding it from anybody, I’m not going to delude myself from what’s actually going on. [4]

> What you feel tells you nothing about the facts—it merely tells you something about your estimate of the facts.

It’s actually really important to have empty space. If you don’t have a day or two every week in your calendar where you’re not always in meetings, and you’re not always busy, then you’re not going to be able to think. You’re not going to be able to have good ideas for your business.

You’re not going to be able to make good judgments. I also encourage taking at least one day a week (preferably two, because if you budget two, you’ll end up with one) where you just have time to think.

It’s only after you’re bored you have the great ideas. It’s never going to be when you’re stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time. [7]

> Very smart people tend to be weird since they insist on thinking everything through for themselves.

> A contrarian isn’t one who always objects—that’s a conformist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently from the ground up and resists pressure to conform.

> Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy. Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed.

### 如何清晰思考

> "清晰的思考者"是比"聪明"更好的赞美。

真正的知识是内在的，是从基础开始构建的。以数学为例，你不能在没有理解算术和几何的情况下理解三角学。基本上，如果有人使用很多华丽的词汇和大量的高级概念，他们可能并不真正理解自己在说什么。我认为最聪明的人可以向孩子解释事物。如果你不能向孩子解释清楚，那你就不真正理解它。这是一个常见的说法，而且非常正确。

理查德·费曼在《六个简单的部分》中非常著名地做到了这一点，这是他早期的一次物理学讲座。他基本上在三页纸内解释了数学。他从数轴开始——计数——然后一路讲到预备微积分。他通过一个不间断的逻辑链条来构建这一切，而不依赖于任何定义。

真正聪明的思考者是清晰的思考者。他们在非常非常基本的层面上理解基础知识。我宁愿非常透彻地理解基础知识，也不愿死记硬背那些我无法串联起来、也无法从基础推导出来的复杂概念。如果你不能在需要时从基础推导出概念，你就会迷失。你只是在死记硬背。[4]

某一领域的高级概念往往不那么可靠。我们用它们来显示内部知识，但我们最好还是打好基础。[11]

> 清晰的思考者相信自己的权威。

**做出有效决策的部分关键在于面对现实。当你做决定时，如何确保你在面对现实？**

不要有太强的自我意识或判断力，也不要总是心不在焉。"猴子心态"总是会用这种反复的情绪反应来应对它认为世界应该是的样子。这些欲望会模糊你的现实。当人们把政治和商业混在一起时，这种情况经常发生。

阻碍我们看清现实的首要因素是我们对事物应有的样子有先入为主的观念。

对痛苦的一种定义是“看到事情本来的样子之时”。一直以来，你确信你的业务做得很好，而实际上你忽视了它并不顺利的迹象。然后，你的业务失败了，你感到痛苦，因为你一直在推迟面对现实，你一直在对自己隐瞒真相。

好消息是，痛苦的时刻——当你处于痛苦中——是一个真相的时刻。那是你被迫接受现实的时刻。然后，你可以做出有意义的改变和进步。只有从真相出发，你才能取得进步。

困难的是看到真相。要看到真相，你必须放下自我，因为自我不愿面对真相。你的自我越小，你的反应越不受制约，你对结果的欲望越少，就越容易看到现实。

> 我们希望为真的东西会模糊我们对真实的感知。痛苦是我们无法再否认现实的时刻。

想象一下，我们正在经历一些困难，比如分手、失业、业务失败或健康问题，而我们的朋友在给我们建议。当我们在给他们建议时，答案显而易见。我们一分钟内就能得出答案，并告诉他们：“哦，那女孩，忘了她吧，她本来就不适合你。你会更快乐的。相信我，你会找到更好的人。”

你知道正确的答案，但你的朋友看不到，因为他们正处于痛苦之中。他们仍然希望现实是不同的。问题不在于现实。问题是他们的欲望与现实发生了冲突，使他们无法看到真相，无论你说多少次。同样的事情也发生在我做决定时。

我对某件事情以某种方式解决的欲望越强，我就越不可能看到真相。特别是在商业中，如果某些事情进展不顺利，我会尽量公开承认，并且我会在联合创始人、朋友和同事面前公开承认。这样，我就不会对任何人隐瞒它。如果我不对任何人隐瞒，我就不会欺骗自己，否认实际发生的事情。[4]

> 你的感受并不能告诉你事实是什么——它只能告诉你你对事实的估计。

实际上，留出空白时间非常重要。如果你的日程中没有一天或两天没有总是在开会，没有总是很忙，那么你就无法思考。你就无法为你的业务提出好的想法。

你就无法做出正确的判断。我还建议每周至少留出一天（最好两天，因为如果你预算两天，最终可能只有一天），让自己有时间去思考。

只有在你感到无聊之后，你才会有伟大的想法。它绝不会在你感到压力、忙碌、奔波或匆忙时出现。留出时间。[7]

> 非常聪明的人往往有些怪，因为他们坚持自己独立思考每一件事。

> 一个反向者并不是总是反对的人——那只是另一种形式的顺从者。一个反向者是从基础独立推理，并抵制顺从压力的人。

> 愤世嫉俗很容易。模仿也很容易。乐观的反向者是最稀有的。
