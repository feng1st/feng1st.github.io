### Find Work That Feels Like Play

Humans evolved as hunters and gatherers where we all worked for ourselves. It’s only at the beginning of agriculture we became more hierarchical. The Industrial Revolution and factories made us extremely hierarchical because one individual couldn’t necessarily own or build a factory, but now, thanks to the internet, we’re going back to an age where more and more people can work for themselves. I would rather be a failed entrepreneur than someone who never tried. Because even a failed entrepreneur has the skill set to make it on their own. [14]

> There are almost 7 billion people on this planet. Someday, I hope, there will be almost 7 billion companies.

I learned how to make money because it was a necessity. After it stopped being a necessity, I stopped caring about it. At least for me, work was a means to an end. Making money was a means to an end. I’m much more interested in solving problems than I am in making money.

Any end goal will just lead to another goal, lead to another goal. We just play games in life. When you grow up, you’re playing the school game, or you’re playing the social game. Then you’re playing the money game, and then you’re playing the status game. These games just have longer and longer and longerlived horizons. At some point, at least I believe, these are all just games. These are games where the outcome really stops mattering once you see through the game.

Then you just get tired of games. I would say I’m at the stage where I’m just tired of games. I don’t think there is any end goal or purpose. I’m just living life as I want to. I’m literally just doing it moment to moment.

I want to be off the hedonic treadmill. [1]

What you really want is freedom. You want freedom from your money problems, right? I think that’s okay. Once you can solve your money problems, either by lowering your lifestyle or by making enough money, you want to retire. Not retirement at sixty-five years old, sitting in a nursing home collecting a check retirement—it’s a different definition.

**What is your definition of retirement?**

Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.

**How do you get there?**

Well, one way is to have so much money saved that your passive income (without you lifting a finger) covers your burn rate.

A second is you just drive your burn rate down to zero—you become a monk.

A third is you’re doing something you love. You enjoy it so much, it’s not about the money. So there are multiple ways to retirement.

The way to get out of the competition trap is to be authentic, to find the thing you know how to do better than anybody. You know how to do it better because you love it, and no one can compete with you. If you love to do it, be authentic, and then figure out how to map that to what society actually wants. Apply some leverage and put your name on it. You take the risks, but you gain the rewards, have ownership and equity in what you’re doing, and just crank it up. [77]

**Did your motivation to earn money drop after you become financially independent?**

Yes and no. It did in the sense the desperation was gone.

But if anything, creating businesses and making money are now more of an “art.” [74]

> Whether in commerce, science, or politics—history remembers the artists.

Art is creativity. Art is anything done for its own sake. What are the things that are done for their own sake, and there’s nothing behind them? Loving somebody, creating something, playing. To me, creating businesses is play. I create businesses because it’s fun, because I’m into the product. [77]

I can create a new business within three months: raise the money, assemble a team, and launch it. It’s fun for me. It’s really cool to see what can I put together. It makes money almost as a side effect. Creating businesses is the game I became good at. It’s just my motivation has shifted from being goal-oriented to being artistic. Ironically, I think I’m much better at it now. [74]

Even when I invest, it’s because I like the people involved, I like hanging out with them, I learn from them, I think the product is really cool. These days, I will pass on great investments because I don’t find the products interesting.

These are not 100 percent-or-nothing things. You can start moving more and more toward that goal in your life. It’s a goal.

When I was younger, I used to be so desperate to make money that I would have done anything. If you’d shown up and said, “Hey, I’ve got a sewage trucking business, want to go into that?” I would have said, “Great, I want to make money!” Thank God no one gave me that opportunity. I’m glad I went down the road of technology and science, which I genuinely enjoy. I got to combine my vocation and my avocation.

I’m always “working.” It looks like work to others, but it feels like play to me. And that’s how I know no one can compete with me on it. Because I’m just playing, for sixteen hours a day. If others want to compete with me, they’re going to work, and they’re going to lose because they’re not going to do it for sixteen hours a day, seven days a week. [77]

**What was your figure where you thought you were financially safe?**

Money is not the root of all evil; there’s nothing evil about it. But the lust for money is bad. The lust for money is not bad in a social sense. It’s not bad in the sense of “you’re a bad person for lusting for money.” It’s bad for you.

Lusting for money is bad for us because it is a bottomless pit. It will always occupy your mind. If you love money, and you make it, there’s never enough. There is never enough because the desire is turned on and doesn’t turn off at some number. It’s a fallacy to think it turns off at some number.

The punishment for the love of money is delivered at the same time as the money. As you make money, you just want even more, and you become paranoid and fearful of losing what you do have. There’s no free lunch.

You make money to solve your money and material problems. I think the best way to stay away from this constant love of money is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money. It’s very easy to keep upgrading your lifestyle as you make money. But if you can hold your lifestyle fixed and hopefully make your money in giant lump sums as opposed to a trickle at a time, you won’t have time to upgrade your lifestyle. You may get so far ahead you actually become financially free.

Another thing that helps: I value freedom above everything else. All kinds of freedom: freedom to do what I want, freedom from things I don’t want to do, freedom from my own emotions or things that may disturb my peace. For me, freedom is my number one value.

To the extent money buys freedom, it’s great. But to the extent it makes me less free, which it definitely does at some level as well, I don’t like it. [74]

> The winners of any game are the people who are so addicted they continue playing even as the marginal utility from winning declines.

**Do I have to start a company to be successful?**

The most successful class of people in Silicon Valley on a consistent basis are either the venture capitalists (because they are diversified and control what used to be a scarce resource) or people who are very good at identifying companies that have just hit product/market fit. Those people have the background, expertise, and references those companies really want to help them scale. Then, they go into the latest Dropbox or the latest Airbnb.

**The people who were at Google, then joined Facebook when it was one hundred people, and then joined Stripe when it was one hundred people?**

When Zuckerberg was just starting to scale his company and panicked, he was like, “I don’t know how to do this.” And he called Jim Breyer [venture capitalist and founder of Accel Partners]. And Jim Breyer said, “Well, I have this really great head of product at this other company, and you need this person.” Those people tend to do the best, risk-adjusted over a long period of time, other than the venture investors themselves. [30]

Some of the most successful people I’ve seen in Silicon Valley had breakouts very early in their careers. They got promoted to VP, director, or CEO, or started a company that did well fairly early. If you’re not getting promoted through the ranks, it gets a lot harder to catch up later in life. It’s good to be in a smaller company early because there’s less of an infrastructure to prevent early promotion. [76]

For someone who is early in their career (and maybe even later), the single most important thing about a company is the alumni network you’re going to build. Think about who you will work with and what those people are going on to do. [76]

### 找到让你感觉像在玩耍一样的工作

人类在进化过程中是作为猎人和采集者出现的，那时候我们都是为自己而工作。直到农业的开始，我们才变得更具等级性。工业革命和工厂的出现使我们变得极为等级化，因为一个人不可能拥有或建造一座工厂，但现在，多亏了互联网，我们正在回到一个越来越多的人可以为自己工作的时代。我宁愿成为一个失败的企业家，也不愿成为一个从未尝试过的人。因为即使是失败的企业家也具备独立生存的技能。[14]

> 这个星球上有将近 70 亿人。总有一天，我希望将会有将近 70 亿家公司。

我学会赚钱是因为这是一种必需。当它不再是必需时，我就不再关心它了。至少对我来说，工作是一种手段。赚钱是一种手段。我对解决问题比对赚钱更感兴趣。

任何最终目标都会引向另一个目标，再引向另一个目标。我们在人生中只是在玩各种游戏。当你长大后，你在玩学校游戏，或者你在玩社交游戏。然后你在玩金钱游戏，然后是地位游戏。这些游戏的时间跨度越来越长。至少我相信，在某个时候，这些只不过都是游戏罢了。一旦你看透了这些游戏，它们的结果就不再重要。

然后你就会对这些游戏感到厌倦。我会说我现在处于对这些游戏感到厌倦的阶段。我不认为有任何最终目标或目的。我只是按照自己的意愿生活。我真的只是活在当下。

我想跳出享乐主义的跑步机。[1]

你真正想要的是自由。你想要摆脱财务问题，对吧？我认为这没问题。一旦你能解决财务问题，无论是通过降低生活水平，还是通过赚足够的钱，你就想退休。不是那种 65 岁后住在养老院里领取支票的退休——这是不同的定义。

**你的退休定义是什么？**

退休是当你不再为了一个想象中的明天而牺牲今天。当今天本身就是完整的时候，你就退休了。

**如何达到这个目标？**

嗯，一种方法是存足够多的钱，以至于你的被动收入（不用你动一根手指）就能覆盖你的支出。

第二种方法是你把支出降到零——你成为了一名僧侣。

第三种方法是你在做你热爱的事情。你如此喜欢它，这与钱无关。所以有多种方法可以实现退休。

摆脱竞争陷阱的方法是真实，找到你最擅长的事情。你之所以比别人做得好，是因为你热爱它，没有人能与你竞争。如果你喜欢做它，保持真实，然后找出如何将其映射到社会的实际需求中。施加一些杠杆并把你的名字放在上面。你承担风险，但你获得回报，在你所做的事情上拥有所有权和股权，然后不断提升。[77]

**你在财务独立之后对赚钱的动力有所下降吗？**

是，也不是。在某种意义上，绝望感消失了。

但如果说有什么变化的话，创造企业和赚钱现在更多是一种“艺术”。[74]

> 无论是在商业、科学，还是政治领域——历史会记住那些艺术家。

艺术就是创造力。艺术是任何为了它自身而完成的事情。什么是为了它自身而完成的事情，并且背后没有任何其他目的？爱一个人，创造一些东西，玩耍。对我来说，创办企业就是玩耍。我创办企业是因为这很有趣，因为我喜欢这个产品。[77]

我可以在三个月内创立一家新公司：筹集资金，组建团队，启动它。这对我来说很有趣。看看我能拼凑出什么东西真的很酷。赚钱几乎是副产品。创办企业是我擅长的游戏。只是我的动力从以目标为导向转变为以艺术为导向。具有讽刺意味的是，我认为现在我做得更好了。[74]

即使是投资，我也是因为喜欢参与其中的人，喜欢和他们在一起，我从他们身上学习，我觉得产品很酷。现在，如果我对产品不感兴趣，即使是很好的投资机会，我也会放弃。

这些事情不是百分百或什么都没有的事。你可以在生活中逐渐朝着这个目标前进。这是一个目标。

当我年轻的时候，我对赚钱非常渴望，以至于什么都愿意做。如果你出现并说：“嘿，我有一个污水运输的生意，你想加入吗？”我会说：“太好了，我想赚钱！”谢天谢地，没有人给我这个机会。我很高兴我走上了科技和科学的道路，这是我真正喜欢的。我得以将我的职业和业余爱好结合起来。

我总是在“工作”。对别人来说看起来像工作，但对我来说像玩耍。这就是我知道没有人能与我竞争的原因。因为我只是在玩，每天 16 个小时。如果别人想和我竞争，他们是在工作，而他们会失败，因为他们不会每天 16 个小时、一周 7 天地做下去。[77]

**你觉得自己财务安全的标准是什么？**

金钱不是万恶之源，它没有什么邪恶之处。但对金钱的渴望是坏的。对金钱的渴望在社会意义上并不是坏事。并不是说“你渴望金钱是个坏人”的意义上是坏的。它对你自己来说是坏的。

对金钱的渴望对我们不好，因为它是一个无底洞。它会一直占据你的心智。如果你爱金钱，并且你得到了它，那就永远不够。永远不会够，因为这种欲望被激活了，不会在某个数额上停下来。认为它会在某个数额上停止是一个谬论。

对金钱的渴望的惩罚和金钱是同时到来的。当你赚到钱时，你只会想要更多，你会变得对失去自己拥有的东西感到偏执和恐惧。没有免费的午餐。

你赚钱是为了解决你的财务和物质问题。我认为远离对金钱的持续热爱的最好方法是，不要在你赚钱的时候升级你的生活方式。随着你赚钱，升级生活方式非常容易。但如果你能保持生活方式固定，并希望你能一次性赚大笔钱，而不是一点一点地赚，你就没有时间去升级生活方式。你可能会进展到一个阶段，真正实现财务自由。

另一个有帮助的事情是：我重视自由胜过一切。各种自由：做我想做的事情的自由，不做我不想做的事情的自由，摆脱我自己的情绪或可能干扰我内心平静的事情的自由。对我来说，自由是我最重要的价值观。

在某种程度上，金钱可以买到自由，这是好事。但在某种程度上，它也确实让我失去了自由，这一点我并不喜欢。[74]

> 任何游戏的赢家都是那些如此沉迷，以至于即使边际收益递减也继续玩的玩家。

**我必须创办公司才能成功吗？**

在硅谷，最成功的人群通常是风险投资家（因为他们多元化并掌握了曾经稀缺的资源），或者是那些非常擅长识别刚刚达到产品/市场契合的公司的群体。这些人拥有这些公司非常想要帮助其扩展的背景、专业知识和人脉。然后，他们就加入了最新的 Dropbox 或 Airbnb。

**那些曾在 Google 工作，然后加入只有一百人的 Facebook，然后又加入只有一百人的 Stripe 的人？**

当扎克伯格刚开始扩展公司而感到慌乱时，他说：“我不知道该怎么做。”于是他打电话给吉姆·布雷耶（Accel Partners 的创始人之一）。吉姆·布雷耶说：“我在另一家公司有一个非常出色的产品负责人，你需要这个人。”这些人在长时间的风险调整后往往表现最好，除了风险投资者本身以外。[30]

我在硅谷见过的一些最成功的人在职业生涯的早期就实现了突破。他们在早期就晋升为副总裁、总监或首席执行官，或者创办了一家相当成功的公司。如果你没有通过阶层晋升，后来赶超会变得更加困难。早期加入一家小公司是很好的，因为在那里晋升的阻碍较少。[76]

对于刚开始职业生涯的人（甚至可能对于那些已经有些资历的人），关于一家公司最重要的一件事是你将建立的校友网络。想一想你会与谁共事，那些人之后会做些什么。[76]
