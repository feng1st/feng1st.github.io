### The Present Is All We Have

There is actually nothing but this moment. No one has ever gone back in time, and no one has ever been able to successfully predict the future in any way that matters. Literally, the only thing that exists is this exact point where you are in space at the exact time you happen to be here.

Like all great profound truths, it’s all paradoxes. Any two points are infinitely different. Any moment is perfectly unique. Each moment itself slips by so quickly you can’t grab it. [4]

You’re dying and being reborn at every moment. It’s up to you whether to forget or remember that. [2]

> You will never be lovelier than you are now, and we will never be here again.”  
> —Homer, The Iliad

I don’t even remember what I said two minutes ago. At best, the past is some fictional little memory tape in my head. As far as I’m concerned, my past is dead. It’s gone. All death really means is that there are no more future moments. [2]

### 当下即是一切

其实，除了此刻之外，什么都不存在。从来没有人能够回到过去，也从来没有人能真正预测未来。字面上说，唯一存在的，就是你在此时此地的这一刻。

如同所有深刻的真理，这一切都是悖论。任何两点都是无穷不同的，任何一个时刻都是绝对独特的。每一个瞬间都如此快速地滑过，无法捕捉。[4]

你在每一刻都在死亡并重生。至于你是选择遗忘还是记住这一点，取决于你自己。[2]

> "一切更加美丽，正因为我们注定会灭亡。  
> 你永远不会比现在更美，而我们也不会再相聚于此。"  
> ——荷马，《伊利亚特》

我甚至不记得自己两分钟前说了什么。充其量，过去只不过是我脑海中虚构的小片记忆带。在我看来，我的过去已然死去，已经消失。死亡的真正含义，就是没有未来的时刻了。[2]
