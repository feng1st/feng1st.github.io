### Be Patient

One thing I figured out later in life is generally (at least in the tech business in Silicon Valley), great people have great outcomes. You just have to be patient. Every person I met at the beginning of my career twenty years ago, where I looked at them and said, “Wow, that guy or gal is super capable—so smart and dedicated”…all of them, almost without exception became extremely successful. You just had to give them a long enough timescale. It never happens in the timescale you want, or they want, but it does happen. [4]

> Apply specific knowledge with leverage and eventually, you will get what you deserve.

It takes time—even once you have all of these pieces in place, there is an indeterminate amount of time you have to put in. If you’re counting, you’ll run out of patience before success actually arrives.

Everybody wants to get rich immediately, but the world is an efficient place; immediate doesn’t work. You do have to put in the time. You do have to put in the hours, and so I think you have to put yourself in the position with the specific knowledge, with accountability, with leverage, with the authentic skill set you have, to be the best in the world at what you do.

You have to enjoy it and keep doing it, keep doing it, and keep doing it. Don’t keep track, and don’t keep count because if you do, you will run out of time. [78]

The most common bad advice I hear is: “You’re too young.” Most of history was built by young people. They just got credit when they were older. The only way to truly learn something is by doing it. Yes, listen to guidance. But don’t wait. [3]

> People are oddly consistent. Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve.  
> Always pay it forward. And don’t keep count.

This is not to say it’s easy. It’s not easy. It’s actually really freaking hard. It is the hardest thing you will do. But it’s also rewarding. Look at the kids who are born rich—they have no meaning to their lives.

Your real résumé is just a catalog of all your suffering. If I ask you to describe your real life to yourself, and you look back from your deathbed at the interesting things you’ve done, it’s all going to be around the sacrifices you made, the hard things you did.

However, anything you’re given doesn’t matter. You have your four limbs, your brain, your head, your skin—that’s all for granted. You have to do hard things anyway to create your own meaning in life. Making money is a fine thing to choose. Go struggle. It is hard. I’m not going to say it’s easy. It’s really hard, but the tools are all available. It’s all out there. [77]

Money buys you freedom in the material world. It’s not going to make you happy, it’s not going to solve your health problems, it’s not going to make your family great, it’s not going to make you fit, it’s not going to make you calm. But it will solve a lot of external problems. It’s a reasonable step to go ahead and make money. [10]

What making money will do is solve your money problems. It will remove a set of things that could get in the way of being happy, but it is not going to make you happy. I know many very wealthy people who are unhappy. Most of the time, the person you have to become to make money is a high-anxiety, high-stress, hard-working, competitive person. When you have done that for twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years, and you suddenly make money, you can’t turn it off. You’ve trained yourself to be a high-anxiety person. Then, you have to learn how to be happy. [11]

Let’s get you rich first. I’m very practical about it because, you know, Buddha was a prince. He started off really rich, then he got to go off in the woods.

In the old days, if you wanted to be peaceful inside, you would become a monk. You would give up everything, renounce sex, children, money, politics, science, technology, everything, and you would go out in the woods by yourself. You had to give everything up to be free inside.

Today, with this wonderful invention called money, you can store it in a bank account. You can you work really hard, do great things for society, and society will give you money for things it wants but doesn’t know how to get. You can save money, you can live a little below your means, and you can find a certain freedom.

That will give you the time and the energy to pursue your own internal peace and happiness. I believe the solution to making everybody happy is to give them what they want.

Let’s get them all rich.

Let’s get them all fit and healthy.

Then, let’s get them all happy. [77]

### 保持耐心

有一件事我在晚年才明白，一般来说（至少在硅谷的科技行业），优秀的人会有优秀的结果。你只需要耐心等待。我在二十年前职业生涯开始时遇到的每一个人，那些让我看着他们说“哇，这个家伙或姑娘超级有能力——非常聪明和投入”的人……他们几乎无一例外地变得非常成功。你只需要给他们足够长的时间。这从来不会在你想要的时间尺度内发生，也不会在他们想要的时间内发生，但最终它会发生。[4]

> 运用独特的知识并结合杠杆，最终你会得到应得的回报。

这需要时间——即使当你已经拥有了所有这些要素，你仍需要投入一个不确定的时间。如果你在计数，你会在成功到来之前失去耐心。

每个人都想立刻变得富有，但这个世界是一个有效率的地方；“立刻”不起作用。你确实需要花时间，确实需要付出努力。因此，我认为你需要让自己处于一种位置，拥有独特的知识，肩负责任，有杠杆，并且具备你真实的技能，以便在你所做的事情上成为世界上最好的。

你必须喜欢它，不断去做，不断去做，不断去做。不要计较，不要计数，因为如果你这样做，你就会失去耐心。[78]

我听到的最常见的糟糕建议是：“你太年轻了。”历史的大部分是由年轻人创造的。他们只是等到年纪大了才得到认可。真正学会某件事的唯一方式是去做。是的，听取指导。但不要等待。[3]

> 人们奇怪地一致。因果报应只是你不断重复你的行为模式、美德和缺点，直到你最终得到你应得的。  
> 永远向前付出。不要计数。

这并不是说这很容易。它并不容易。实际上真的非常非常难。这是你将做的最困难的事情。但它也是有回报的。看看那些生来富有的孩子——他们的生活没有任何意义。

你真正的简历只是你所有痛苦的目录。如果我让你向自己描述你真实的生活，并且你从临终时回顾你做过的有趣的事情，那全都是围绕着你做出的牺牲和你所做的困难的事情。

然而，任何你被给予的东西都无关紧要。你有四肢，你有大脑，你有头，你有皮肤——这一切都是理所当然的。你必须不论如何去做困难的事情，为自己创造生活的意义。挣钱是一个很好的选择。去奋斗吧。这很难。我不会说这容易。这真的很难，但工具都已经在那里了。这一切都在那里。[77]

金钱在物质世界中为你买来自由。它不会让你幸福，不会解决你的健康问题，不会让你的家庭更好，不会让你变得健壮，也不会让你平静。但它确实会解决很多外部问题。赚些钱是一个合理的步骤。[10]

赚钱能做的是解决你的财务问题。它会移除一些可能阻碍你幸福的事情，但它并不会让你幸福。我认识许多非常富有但不幸福的人。大多数情况下，为了赚钱你必须成为一个高焦虑、高压力、努力工作、竞争激烈的人。当你这样做了二十、三十、四十、五十年，突然之间赚到了钱，你是无法把这些特质关掉的。你已经训练自己成为一个高焦虑的人。然后，你必须重新学习如何幸福。[11]

让我们先让你变富吧。我对此非常现实，因为你知道，佛陀曾是个王子。他一开始非常富有，然后他去森林里修行。

在过去，如果你想内心平静，你会成为一个僧侣。你会放弃一切，放弃性、孩子、金钱、政治、科学、技术，一切，然后你会独自去森林里。你必须放弃一切才能在内心自由。

而如今，有了这个叫做金钱的美妙发明，你可以把它存入银行账户。你可以努力工作，为社会做出巨大贡献，社会会给你钱来换取它想要但不知道如何得到的东西。你可以存钱，生活得稍微节俭一些，然后你就能找到某种自由。

这将给你时间和精力去追求你自己的内心平和和幸福。我相信让每个人都幸福的解决方案就是给他们想要的东西。

让我们让所有人都富有。

让我们让所有人都健康。

然后，让我们让他们都幸福。[77]
