### Play Long-Term Games with Long-Term People

**You said, “All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.” How does one know if they’re earning compound interest?**

Compound interest is a very powerful concept. Compound interest applies to more than just compounding capital. Compounding capital is just the beginning.

Compounding in business relationships is very important. Look at some of the top roles in society, like why someone is a CEO of a public company or managing billions of dollars. It’s because people trust them. They are trusted because the relationships they’ve built and the work they’ve done has compounded. They’ve stuck with the business and shown themselves (in a visible and accountable way) to be high integrity people.

Compound interest also happens in your reputation. If you have a sterling reputation and you keep building it for decades upon decades, people will notice. Your reputation will literally end up being thousands or tens of thousands of times more valuable than somebody else who was very talented but is not keeping the compound interest in reputation going.

This is also true when you’re working with individual people. If you’ve worked with somebody for five or ten years and you still enjoy working with them, obviously you trust them, and the little foibles are gone. All the normal negotiations in business relationships can work very simply because you trust each other—you know it will work out.

For example, there’s another Angel in Silicon Valley named Elad Gil who I like to do deals with.

I love working with Elad because I know when the deal is being done, he will bend over backward to give me extra. He will always round off in my favor if there’s an extra dollar being delivered here or there. If there’s some cost to pay, he will pay it out of his own pocket, and he won’t even mention it to me. Because he goes so far out of his way to treat me so well, I send him every deal I have—I try to include him in everything. Then, I go out of my way to try and pay for him. Compounding in those relationships is very valuable. [10]

> Intentions don’t matter. Actions do. That’s why being ethical is hard.

When you find the right thing to do, when you find the right people to work with, invest deeply. Sticking with it for decades is really how you make the big returns in your relationships and in your money. So, compound interest is very important. [10]

> 99% of effort is wasted.

Obviously, nothing is ever completely wasted because it’s all a learning moment. You can learn from anything. But for example, when you go back to school, 99 percent of the term papers you did, books you read, exercises you did, things you learned, they don’t really apply. You might have read geography and history you never reuse. You might have studied a language you don’t speak anymore. You might have studied a branch of mathematics you completely forgot.

Of course, these are learning experiences. You did learn. You learned the value of hard work; you might have learned something that went deep into your psyche and became a piece of what you’re doing now. But at least when it comes to the goal-oriented life, only about 1 percent of the efforts you made paid off.

Another example is all the people you dated until you met your husband or wife. It was wasted time in the goal sense. Not wasted in the exponential sense, not wasted in the learning sense, but definitely wasted in the goal sense.

The reason I say this is not to make some glib comment about how 99 percent of your life is wasted and only 1 percent is useful. I say this because you should be very thoughtful and realize in most things (relationships, work, even in learning) what you’re trying to do is find the thing you can go all-in on to earn compound interest.

When you’re dating, the instant you know this relationship is not going to be the one that leads to marriage, you should probably move on. When you’re studying something, like a geography or history class, and you realize you are never going to use the information, drop the class. It’s a waste of time. It’s a waste of your brain energy.

I’m not saying don’t do the 99 percent, because it’s very hard to identify what the 1 percent is. What I’m saying is: when you find the 1 percent of your discipline which will not be wasted, which you’ll be able to invest in for the rest of your life and has meaning to you—go all-in and forget about the rest.

### 与长期思维的人玩长期游戏

**你说过：“生活中的所有回报，无论是财富、关系还是知识，都来自于复利。”那如何知道自己是否在赚取复利？**

复利是一个非常强大的概念。复利不仅仅适用于资本的增长。资本的复利只是个开始。

在商业关系中，复利也非常重要。看看社会中的一些顶级职位，比如某人为什么能成为一家上市公司的CEO或管理数十亿的资金。这是因为人们信任他们。他们之所以被信任，是因为他们建立的关系和完成的工作具有复利效应。他们坚持在商业中，展示自己是值得信赖的人（公开且负责任地）。

复利同样也体现在你的声誉中。如果你有一个良好的声誉，并且几十年如一日地保持它，人们会注意到。你的声誉最终会比某个同样有才华但没有保持声誉复利的人价值数千倍、甚至数万倍。

这也适用于你与个人的合作。如果你和某个人合作了五到十年，依然喜欢和他们一起工作，显然你们是相互信任的，所有的小毛病也已经消失了。在商业关系中，所有的常规谈判都可以非常简单，因为你们彼此信任——你知道一切都会顺利。

例如，在硅谷有另一位天使投资人叫Elad Gil，我喜欢和他一起做交易。

我喜欢和Elad合作，因为我知道在交易达成时，他会竭尽全力为我提供额外的帮助。如果有额外的一美元被分配到某处，他会总是偏向我这边。如果有需要支付的成本，他会自掏腰包，甚至不会向我提起。因为他如此努力地善待我，所以我会把我所有的交易都送给他——我尽量把他包含在一切事物中。然后，我也会竭尽全力为他买单。在这种关系中，复利非常有价值。[10]

> 意图不重要，行动才重要。这就是为什么坚持道德是困难的。

当你找到正确的事情去做，当你找到合适的人一起工作时，要深入投资。几十年如一日地坚持，才是你在人际关系和财富中获得丰厚回报的方式。因此，复利非常重要。[10]

> 99%的努力是浪费的。

显然，没有什么是完全浪费的，因为一切都是学习的时刻。你可以从任何事情中学习。但例如，当你回到学校时，99%的论文、书籍、练习和学习的内容并没有真正派上用场。你可能读了再也用不到的地理和历史，可能学习了一门现在不再说的语言，或者学习了一门完全忘记了的数学分支。

当然，这些都是学习的经验。你确实学到了东西，你学到了勤奋的价值，也可能学到了一些深入你心灵的东西，成为了你现在所做事情的一部分。但至少在目标导向的生活中，只有大约1%的努力是有回报的。

另一个例子是你和你配偶相遇前的所有约会。它们在目标意义上是浪费的。从指数的意义上说不是浪费，从学习的意义上说也不是浪费，但在目标意义上肯定是浪费的。

我这样说不是为了发表一些轻率的评论，说你99%的生活是浪费的，只有1%是有用的。我这样说是因为你应该非常认真地认识到，在大多数事情（人际关系、工作，甚至是学习）中，你想要做的是找到你可以全力以赴去获得复利的事情。

当你在约会时，一旦你知道这段关系不会导致婚姻，你大概应该继续前行。当你在学习某些东西，比如地理或历史课，并意识到你永远不会用到这些信息时，退掉课程。这是浪费时间，是对脑力的浪费。

我不是说不要做那99%的事，因为识别出那1%是非常困难的。我要说的是：当你找到那1%不会被浪费、你可以在余生中投资并对你有意义的领域时——全力以赴并忘记其他的一切。[10]
