### Build or Buy Equity in a Business

> If you don’t own a piece of a business, you don’t have a path towards financial freedom.

Why is owning equity in a business important to becoming rich?

It’s ownership versus wage work. If you are paid for renting out your time, even lawyers and doctors, you can make some money, but you’re not going to make the money that gives you financial freedom. You’re not going to have passive income where a business is earning for you while you are on vacation. [10]

This is probably one of the most important points. People seem to think you can create wealth—make money through work. It’s probably not going to work. There are many reasons for that.

Without ownership, your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even one paying a lot per hour like a lawyer or a doctor, you’re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.

Without ownership, when you’re sleeping, you’re not earning. When you’re retired, you’re not earning. When you’re on vacation, you’re not earning. And you can’t earn nonlinearly.

If you look at even doctors who get rich (like really rich), it’s because they open a business. They open a private practice. The private practice builds a brand, and the brand attracts people. Or they build some kind of a medical device, a procedure, or a process with an intellectual property.

Essentially, you’re working for somebody else, and that person is taking on the risk and has the accountability, the intellectual property, and the brand. They’re not going to pay you enough. They’re going to pay you the bare minimum they have to, to get you to do their job. That can be a high bare minimum, but it’s still not going to be true wealth where you’re retired but still earning. [78]

Owning equity in a company basically means you own the upside. When you own debt, you own guaranteed revenue streams and you own the downside. You want to own equity. If you don’t own equity in a business, your odds of making money are very slim.

You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important. [10]

Everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product, a business, or some IP. That can be through stock options if you work at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start.

But usually, the real wealth is created by starting your own companies or even by investing. In an investment firm, they’re buying equity. These are the routes to wealth. It doesn’t come through the hours. [78]

### 建立或购买企业的股权

> 如果你不拥有一部分企业，你就没有通往财务自由的路径。

为什么拥有企业的股权对致富很重要？

这涉及所有权与工资工作之间的区别。如果你只是通过出租时间获得报酬，即使是律师和医生，你可以赚到一些钱，但你不会赚到足以让你财务自由的钱。你不会有被动收入，不会有当你在度假时仍然为你赚钱的业务。[10]

这是可能最重要的几点之一。人们似乎认为你可以通过工作创造财富——通过劳动赚钱。但这大概行不通，其中有很多原因。

没有所有权时，你的投入和产出是紧密相连的。在几乎所有的薪资工作中，即使是像律师或医生这样每小时报酬很高的工作，你仍然是在投入时间，而每小时的报酬也是直接相应的。

没有所有权时，当你睡觉时你没有收入。当你退休时你没有收入。当你度假时你没有收入。而且你不能非线性地赚取收入。

即便是那些变得富有的医生（真正富有的那种），也是因为他们开了自己的业务。他们开了私人诊所，诊所建立了品牌，而品牌吸引了人们。或者他们开发了某种医疗器械、程序，或者拥有知识产权的流程。

本质上，你是在为别人工作，而那个人承担了风险，拥有了责任、知识产权和品牌。他们不会支付足够多的钱给你。他们只会支付让你愿意为他们工作的最低限度的薪水。这个最低限度可能很高，但它依然不是你退休后还能赚钱的真正财富。[78]

拥有公司股权基本上意味着你拥有了未来的收益。而当你拥有债务时，你拥有的是保证的收入流和承担下行风险。你应该想要拥有股权。如果你不拥有企业的股权，那么你致富的几率就非常渺茫。

你必须努力直到能够拥有企业的股权。你可以作为小股东购买股票来拥有股权。你也可以自己创办公司来获得所有权。所有权真的非常重要。[10]

每一个真正赚到钱的人在某个阶段都拥有某个产品、一家公司或者某些知识产权的一部分。这可能通过在科技公司工作而获得的股票期权，这是一种很好的起步方式。

但通常情况下，真正的财富是通过创办自己的公司甚至是投资来创造的。在投资公司，他们购买股权。这些是致富的途径。它不是通过工时赚来的。[78]
