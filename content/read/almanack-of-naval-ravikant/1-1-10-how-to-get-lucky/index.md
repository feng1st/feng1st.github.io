### How to Get Lucky

**Why do you say, “Get rich without getting lucky”?**

In 1,000 parallel universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them. You don’t want to be wealthy in the fifty of them where you got lucky, so we want to factor luck out of it.

**But getting lucky would help, right?**

Just recently, Babak Nivi, my co-founder, and I were talking on Twitter about how one gets lucky, and there are really four kinds of luck we were talking about.

The first kind of luck is blind luck where one just gets lucky because something completely out of their control happened. This includes fortune, fate, etc.

Then, there’s luck through persistence, hard work, hustle, and motion. This is when you’re running around creating opportunities. You’re generating a lot of energy, you’re doing a lot to stir things up. It’s almost like mixing a petri dish or mixing a bunch of reagents and seeing what combines. You’re just generating enough force, hustle, and energy for luck to find you.

A third way is you become very good at spotting luck. If you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in your field, and other people who aren’t attuned to it won’t notice. So, you become sensitive to luck.

The last kind of luck is the weirdest, hardest kind, where you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, which causes luck to find you.

For example, let’s say you’re the best person in the world at deep-sea diving. You’re known to take on deep-sea dives nobody else will even dare to attempt. By sheer luck, somebody finds a sunken treasure ship off the coast they can’t get to. Well, their luck just became your luck, because they’re going to come to you to get to the treasure, and you’re going to get paid for it.

This is an extreme example, but it shows how one person had blind luck finding the treasure. Them coming to you to extract it and give you half is not blind luck. You created your own luck. You put yourself in a position to capitalize on luck or to attract luck when nobody else created the opportunity for themselves. To get rich without getting lucky, we want to be deterministic. We don’t want to leave it to chance. [78]

> Ways to get lucky:  
> • Hope luck finds you.  
> • Hustle until you stumble into it.  
> • Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.  
> • Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.

It starts becoming so deterministic, it stops being luck. The definition starts fading from luck to destiny. To summarize the fourth type: build your character in a certain way, then your character becomes your destiny.

One of the things I think is important to make money is having a reputation that makes people do deals through you. Remember the example of being a great diver where treasure hunters will come and give you a piece of the treasure for your diving skills.

If you are a trusted, reliable, high-integrity, long-term-thinking dealmaker, when other people want to do deals but don’t know how to do them in a trustworthy manner with strangers, they will literally approach you and give you a cut of the deal just because of the integrity and reputation you’ve built up.

Warren Buffett gets offered deals to buy companies, buy warrants, bail out banks, and do things other people can’t do because of his reputation. Of course, he has accountability on the line, and he has a strong brand on the line.

Your character and your reputation are things you can build, which will let you take advantage of opportunities other people may characterize as lucky, but you know it wasn’t luck. [78] My co-founder Nivi said, “In a long-term game, it seems that everybody is making each other rich. And in a short-term game, it seems like everybody is making themselves rich.”

I think that is a brilliant formulation. In a long-term game, it’s positive sum. We’re all baking the pie together. We’re trying to make it as big as possible. And in a short-term game, we’re cutting up the pie. [78]

**How important is networking?**

I think business networking is a complete waste of time. And I know there are people and companies popularizing this concept because it serves them and their business model well, but the reality is if you’re building something interesting, you will always have more people who will want to know you. Trying to build business relationships well in advance of doing business is a complete waste of time. I have a much more comfortable philosophy: “Be a maker who makes something interesting people want. Show your craft, practice your craft, and the right people will eventually find you.” [14]

**And once you’ve met someone, how do you determine if you can trust someone? What signals do you pay attention to?**

If someone is talking a lot about how honest they are, they’re probably dishonest. That is just a little telltale indicator I’ve learned. When someone spends too much time talking about their own values or they’re talking themselves up, they’re covering for something. [4]

> Sharks eat well but live a life surrounded by sharks.

I have great people in my life who are extremely successful, very desirable (like everybody wants to be their friend), very smart. Yet, I’ve seen them do one or two things slightly not great to other people. The first time, I’ll say, “Hey, I don’t think you should do this to that other person. Not because you won’t get away with it. You will get away with it, but because it will hurt you in the end.”

Not in some cosmic, karma kind of way, but I believe deep down we all know who we are. You cannot hide anything from yourself. Your own failures are written within your psyche, and they are obvious to you. If you have too many of these moral shortcomings, you will not respect yourself. The worst outcome in this world is not having self-esteem. If you don’t love yourself, who will?

I think you just have to be very careful about doing things you are fundamentally not going to be proud of, because they will damage you. The first time someone acts this way, I will warn them. By the way, nobody changes. Then I just distance myself from them. I cut them out of my life. I just have this saying inside my head: “The closer you want to get to me, the better your values have to be.” [4]

### 如何获得幸运

**为什么你会说“致富而不靠运气”？**

在 1000 个平行宇宙中，你想在其中的 999 个宇宙里都变得富有。你不希望仅仅在那 50 个因为幸运的宇宙中富有，所以我们想把运气排除在外。

**但运气会有帮助，对吧？**

就在最近，我的联合创始人巴巴克·尼维和我在推特上讨论了一个人如何获得运气，我们讨论的实际上是四种运气。

第一种运气是盲目运气，一个人仅仅因为某些完全无法控制的事情发生而走运。这包括命运、宿命等。

然后，有通过坚持不懈、努力工作、奔波和行动得到的运气。这是当你四处奔走创造机会时发生的。你在不断地产生能量，不断搅动环境。这有点像混合培养皿或混合一堆试剂，看会发生什么反应。你产生了足够的力量、忙碌和能量，运气就找到了你。

第三种方式是你变得非常擅长发现运气。如果你在某个领域非常有技能，那么当幸运的机会出现在你的领域时，你会注意到，而那些不熟悉这个领域的人不会注意到。所以，你对运气变得敏感。

最后一种运气是最奇怪、最难的，它是你通过建立独特的性格、独特的品牌、独特的心态，使得运气找上你。

例如，假设你是世界上最擅长深海潜水的人。你以敢于尝试其他人不敢尝试的深海潜水而闻名。碰巧有人在海岸边发现了一艘沉船，他们无法到达。那么，他们的运气就变成了你的运气，因为他们会找到你去探索这个宝藏，而你也因此得到报酬。

这是一个极端的例子，但它展示了一个人靠盲目运气找到了宝藏。而他们找到你去提取宝藏并给你一半报酬并不是盲目的运气。这是你自己创造的运气。你让自己处于可以利用运气或吸引运气的位置，而没有其他人创造这样的机会。要致富而不靠运气，我们需要确定性，而不想把它留给偶然性。[78]

> 获得运气的方法：  
> • 希望运气找到你。  
> • 努力奔波直到偶然遇到它。  
> • 准备好头脑，对他人错过的机会保持敏感。  
> • 成为你所做事情的佼佼者，不断精进，直到这成为现实。机会将会主动找上你。运气变成了你的命运。

这开始变得如此确定性，以至于它不再是运气。定义开始从运气逐渐消失，转变为命运。总结第四种类型：通过某种方式建立你的性格，然后你的性格就会成为你的命运。

我认为赚钱的重要因素之一是拥有一个让人们通过你做交易的声誉。记住那个优秀潜水员的例子，寻宝者会来找你，并因为你的潜水技能给你一部分宝藏。

如果你是一个受信任、可靠、有高诚信、长期思考的交易撮合者，当别人想做交易却不知道如何与陌生人以可信的方式进行时，他们真的会找到你，仅仅因为你积累的诚信和声誉而给你一部分交易。

沃伦·巴菲特就常常被提供收购公司、购买认股权证、拯救银行等交易，这是其他人无法做到的，原因在于他的声誉。当然，他也面临一定的责任，他的品牌价值也很高。

你的性格和声誉是可以建立的，它们会让你利用那些其他人可能认为是运气的机会，但你知道这并不是运气。[78] 我的联合创始人尼维说：“在一个长期的游戏中，每个人似乎都在让彼此变得富有。而在短期游戏中，每个人似乎都在让自己变得富有。”

我觉得这是一个很有智慧的表述。在长期的游戏中，这是一个正和游戏。我们都在一起烤这个大馅饼，努力让它尽可能大。而在短期游戏中，我们是在切分馅饼。[78]

**人脉有多重要？**

我认为商业人脉是完全浪费时间的。我知道有些人和公司在推广这个概念，因为这对他们和他们的商业模式很有利，但事实上，如果你在创造有趣的东西，你会始终有更多人想要认识你。试图在做生意之前提前建立商业关系完全是浪费时间。我有一个更舒服的理念：“成为一个制造有趣东西的人，展示你的技艺，练习你的技艺，最终合适的人会找到你。”[14]

**一旦你遇到某人，你如何判断能否信任他们？你会注意哪些信号？**

如果有人不断谈论他们有多诚实，那么他们可能是不诚实的。这是我学到的一个小小的征兆。当某人花太多时间谈论他们的价值观或夸耀自己时，他们是在掩饰某些东西。[4]

> 鲨鱼吃得好，但生活在被鲨鱼包围的世界里。

我有一些非常成功、非常受欢迎（每个人都想成为他们的朋友）、非常聪明的朋友。然而，我曾看到他们对其他人做过一两件不太好的事情。第一次我会说：“嘿，我觉得你不应该这么对待那个人。不是因为你不会逃脱惩罚。你会逃脱，但这是因为这最终会伤害你自己。”

并不是从某种宇宙业报的角度，而是我相信在内心深处我们都知道自己是谁。你无法对自己隐瞒任何事情。你自己的失败都写在你的心灵深处，对你自己来说一目了然。如果你有太多这样的道德瑕疵，你就不会尊重自己。这个世界上最糟糕的结果就是没有自尊。如果你不爱自己，那谁会爱你呢？

我认为你必须非常小心，不去做那些从根本上不会让你感到自豪的事情，因为它们会伤害你自己。第一次有人这样对待别人时，我会警告他们。顺便说一下，没有人会改变。然后我就会与他们保持距离。我会把他们从我的生活中剔除。我在心里有这么一句话：“你想离我越近，你的价值观就必须越好。”[4]
