### Take on Accountability

> Embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.

To get rich, you need leverage. Leverage comes in labor, comes in capital, or it can come through code or media. But most of these, like labor and capital, people have to give to you. For labor, somebody has to follow you. For capital, somebody has to give you money, assets to manage, or machines.

So to get these things, you have to build credibility, and you have to do it under your own name as much as possible, which is risky. So, accountability is a double-edged thing. It allows you to take credit when things go well and to bear the brunt of the failure when things go badly. [78]

Clear accountability is important. Without accountability, you don’t have incentives. Without accountability, you can’t build credibility. But you take risks. You risk failure. You risk humiliation. You risk failure under your own name.

Luckily, in modern society, there’s no more debtors’ prison and people aren’t imprisoned or executed for losing other people’s money, but we’re still socially hardwired to not fail in public under our own names. The people who have the ability to fail in public under their own names actually gain a lot of power.

I’ll give a personal anecdote. Up until about 2013, 2014, my public persona was entirely around startups and investing. Only around 2014, 2015 did I start talking about philosophy and psychological things and broader things. It made me a little nervous because I was doing it under my own name. There were definitely people in the industry who sent me messages through the backchannel like, “What are you doing? You’re ending your career. This is stupid.”

I kind of just went with it. I took a risk. Same with crypto. Early on, I took a risk. But when you put your name out there, you take a risk with certain things. You also get to reap the rewards. You get the benefits. [78]

In the old days, the captain was expected to go down with the ship. If the ship was sinking, then literally the last person to get off was the captain. Accountability does come with real risks, but we’re talking about a business context.

The risk here would be you would probably be the last one to get your capital back out. You’d be the last one to get paid for your time. The time that you put in, the capital you put into the company, these are at risk. [78]

Realize that in modern society, the downside risk is not that large. Even personal bankruptcy can wipe the debts clean in good ecosystems. I’m most familiar with Silicon Valley, but generally, people will forgive failures as long as you were honest and made a high-integrity effort.

There’s not really that much to fear in terms of failure, and so people should take on a lot more accountability than they do. [78]

### 承担责任

> 拥抱责任，并以你自己的名义承担商业风险。社会将回报你以责任、股权和杠杆。

要变得富有，你需要杠杆。杠杆来自于劳动，来自于资本，或者可以通过代码或媒体获得。但大多数杠杆，比如劳动和资本，都是别人给你的。对于劳动，有人必须跟随你。对于资本，有人必须给你钱、资产去管理，或者机器。

所以，要获得这些，你必须建立信誉，尽可能地用自己的名义去建立，这很有风险。因此，责任是把双刃剑。当事情进展顺利时，它让你获得荣誉，而当事情出错时，你也要承担失败的后果。[78]

明确的责任是重要的。没有责任，你就没有激励。没有责任，你就无法建立信誉。但你需要冒险。你面临失败的风险，面临羞辱的风险，面临在自己名下失败的风险。

幸运的是，在现代社会，已经没有债务人的监狱，人们也不会因为亏损了别人的钱而被监禁或处死，但我们仍然在社交层面上被深深植入了避免公开以自己名义失败的信念。那些能够在公众面前以自己名义失败的人，实际上获得了很多力量。

让我讲一个个人的例子。在大约 2013 年到 2014 年之前，我的公众形象完全围绕在创业和投资上。直到大约 2014 年、2015 年，我才开始谈论哲学、心理学和更广泛的内容。这让我有点紧张，因为我是在用自己的名字做这些事情。当时确实有一些行业内的人通过非公开渠道给我发消息说：“你在干什么？你在毁掉你的职业生涯。这太愚蠢了。”

但我选择继续前行。我冒了风险。同样地，在加密货币方面，早期我也冒了风险。但当你把自己的名字放在那里时，你在某些事情上冒了风险，你也会收获回报，获得收益。[78]

在过去，船长被期望与船共存亡。如果船在下沉，那么最后一个离开的人必须是船长。承担责任确实伴随着真正的风险，但我们在这里谈论的是商业背景。

这里的风险可能是你会是最后一个拿回自己资本的人，你会是最后一个获得时间报酬的人。你投入的时间，你投进公司的资本，都是有风险的。[78]

意识到在现代社会，风险的下行空间并不是那么大。即使是个人破产，也可以在良好的生态系统中清除债务。我对硅谷最熟悉，但一般来说，只要你是诚实的，并做出了高诚信的努力，人们会原谅失败。

在失败方面，其实并没有那么多可怕的地方，所以人们应该比现在承担更多的责任。[78]
