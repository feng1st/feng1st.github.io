### Find and Build Specific Knowledge

Sales skills are a form of specific knowledge.

There’s such a thing as “a natural” in sales. You run into them all the time in startups and venture capital. When you meet someone who is a natural at sales, you just know they’re amazing. They’re really good at what they do. That is a form of specific knowledge.

Obviously they learned somewhere, but they didn’t learn it in a classroom setting. They learned probably in their childhood in the school yard, or they learned negotiating with their parents. Maybe some is a genetic component in the DNA.

But you can improve sales skills. You can read Robert Cialdini, you can go to a sales training seminar, you can do door-to-door sales. It is brutal but will train you very quickly. You can definitely improve your sales skills.

> Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned.

When I talk about specific knowledge, I mean figure out what you were doing as a kid or teenager almost effortlessly. Something you didn’t even consider a skill, but people around you noticed. Your mother or your best friend growing up would know.

Examples of what your specific knowledge could be:

→ Sales skills  
→ Musical talents, with the ability to pick up any instrument  
→ An obsessive personality: you dive into things and remember them quickly  
→ Love for science fiction: you were into reading sci-fi, which means you absorb a lot of knowledge very quickly  
→ Playing a lot of games, you understand game theory pretty well  
→ Gossiping, digging into your friend network. That might make you into a very interesting journalist.

The specific knowledge is sort of this weird combination of unique traits from your DNA, your unique upbringing, and your response to it. It’s almost baked into your personality and your identity. Then you can hone it.

> No one can compete with you on being you. Most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most.

For example, I love to read, and I love technology. I learn very quickly, and I get bored fast. If I had gone into a profession where I was required to tunnel down for twenty years into the same topic, it wouldn’t have worked. I’m in venture investing, which requires me to come up to speed very, very quickly on new technologies (and I’m rewarded for getting bored because new technologies come along). It matches up pretty well with my specific knowledge and skill sets. [10]

I wanted to be a scientist. That is where a lot of my moral hierarchy comes from. I view scientists as being at the top of the production chain for humanity. The group of scientists who have made real breakthroughs and contributions probably added more to human society, I think, than any single other class of human beings. Not to take away anything from art or politics or engineering or business, but without science, we’d still be scrambling in the dirt fighting with sticks and trying to start fires.

> Society, business, & money are downstream of technology, which is itself downstream of science. Science applied is the engine of humanity.  
> Corollary: Applied Scientists are the most powerful people in the world. This will be more obvious in the coming years.

My whole value system was built around scientists, and I wanted to be a great scientist. But when I actually look back at what I was uniquely good at and what I ended up spending my time doing, it was more around making money, tinkering with technology, and selling people on things. Explaining things and talking to people.

I have some sales skills, which is a form of specific knowledge. I have some analytical skills on how to make money. And I have this ability to absorb data, obsess about it, and break it down—that is a specific skill that I have. I also love tinkering with technology. And all of this stuff feels like play to me, but it looks like work to others.

There are other people to whom these things would be hard, and they say, “Well, how do I get good at being pithy and selling ideas?” Well, if you’re not already good at it or if you’re not really into it, maybe it’s not your thing—focus on the thing that you are really into.

The first person to actually point out my real specific knowledge was my mother. She did it as an aside, talking from the kitchen, and she said it when I was fifteen or sixteen years old. I was telling a friend of mine that I want to be an astrophysicist, and she said, “No, you’re going to go into business.” I was like, “What, my mom’s telling me I’m going to be in business? I’m going to be an astrophysicist. Mom doesn’t know she’s talking about.” But Mom knew exactly what she was talking about. [78] '

Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It’s not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job; it’s not by going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.

Very often, specific knowledge is at the edge of knowledge. It’s also stuff that’s only now being figured out or is really hard to figure out. If you’re not 100 percent into it, somebody else who is 100 percent into it will outperform you. And they won’t just outperform you by a little bit—they’ll outperform you by a lot because now we’re operating the domain of ideas, compound interest really applies and leverage really applies. [78]

> The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.

 You can go on the internet, and you can find your audience. And you can build a business, and create a product, and build wealth, and make people happy just uniquely expressing yourself through the internet. [78]

The internet enables any niche interest, as long as you’re the best person at it to scale out. And the great news is because every human is different, everyone is the best at something— being themselves.

Another tweet I had that is worth weaving in, but didn’t go into the “How to Get Rich” tweetstorm, was very simple: “Escape competition through authenticity.” Basically, when you’re competing with people, it’s because you’re copying them. It’s because you’re trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don’t copy. [78]  (*click to tweet)

If you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you on that. Who’s going to compete with Joe Rogan or Scott Adams? It’s impossible. Is somebody else going to come along and write a better Dilbert? No. Is someone going to compete with Bill Watterson and create a better Calvin and Hobbes? No. They’re being authentic. [78]

> The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.

The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn. The old model of making money is going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy.

It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the “right” thing a long time ago. You really care about having studied the foundations, so you’re not scared of any book. If you go to the library and there’s a book you cannot understand, you have to dig down and say, “What is the foundation required for me to learn this?” Foundations are super important. [74]

Basic arithmetic and numeracy are way more important in life than doing calculus. Similarly, being able to convey yourself simply using ordinary English words is far more important than being able to write poetry, having an extensive vocabulary, or speaking seven different foreign languages.

Knowing how to be persuasive when speaking is far more important than being an expert digital marketer or click optimizer. Foundations are key. It’s much better to be at 9/10 or 10/10 on foundations than to try and get super deep into things.

You do need to be deep in something because otherwise you’ll be a mile wide and an inch deep and you won’t get what you want out of life. You can only achieve mastery in one or two things. It’s usually things you’re obsessed about. [74]

### 找到并构建特定的知识

销售技能是一种特定知识。

在销售领域存在所谓的“天生高手”。在初创企业和风险投资中，你会经常遇到这样的人。当你遇到一个在销售上天生出色的人时，你会知道他们很了不起。他们真的很擅长自己的工作。这是一种特定的知识。

显然他们在某处学到了这些技能，但不是在课堂上学到的。他们可能是在童年时在学校的操场上学到的，或者是在与父母的谈判中学到的。也许有些是遗传基因中的一部分。

不过，你可以提高你的销售技能。你可以阅读罗伯特·西奥迪尼的书，参加销售培训研讨会，甚至做门到门的销售。这是非常严酷的，但能很快地训练你。你绝对可以提高你的销售技能。

> 特定知识无法教授，但可以习得。

当我谈到特定知识时，我指的是找出那些你在孩童或青少年时期几乎不费力就能做到的事情。一些你甚至不认为是技能的事情，但周围的人注意到了。你的母亲或你童年时期最好的朋友会知道。

你特定知识的例子可能包括：

→ 销售技能  
→ 音乐天赋，能轻松学会任何乐器  
→ 痴迷的性格：你全身心投入某件事并能快速记住  
→ 对科幻小说的热爱：你喜欢阅读科幻小说，这意味着你能够快速吸收大量知识  
→ 玩很多游戏，因此对博弈论理解相当透彻  
→ 爱八卦，喜欢深挖朋友的社交网络。这可能会使你成为一个非常有趣的记者。

特定知识是一种奇妙的组合，是由你的 DNA 的独特特征、独特的成长经历以及你对这些的回应共同形成的。它几乎融入了你的性格和身份中。之后你可以不断打磨它。

> 没有人能与你竞争成为你自己。大部分人生是在寻找最需要你的事物和人群。

例如，我喜欢阅读，也喜欢科技。我学得很快，但我很快也会厌倦。如果我进入一个需要在同一个话题上钻研二十年的职业，那是不可能成功的。我现在从事风险投资，这需要我非常非常快地了解新技术（而且对我来说，感到厌倦是好事，因为总会有新技术出现）。这与我的特定知识和技能组合得非常好。[10]

我曾想成为一名科学家。这也是我道德体系的来源。我认为科学家在人类生产链中处于顶端。我认为，那些取得真正突破并作出贡献的科学家群体，可能比任何其他类别的人类对社会的贡献都要多。当然，这不是否定艺术、政治、工程或商业的重要性，但如果没有科学，我们仍会在泥土中挣扎，用棍子打斗，尝试生火。

> 社会、商业和金钱都源于技术，而技术本身源于科学。科学的应用是人类进步的引擎。  
> 推论：应用科学家是世界上最有力量的人。这一点在未来几年会变得更加明显。

我的整个价值体系是建立在科学家之上的，我曾想成为一名伟大的科学家。但当我回顾自己独特擅长的事情以及最终花时间做的事情时，更多的是围绕着赚钱、摆弄技术和推销事物。解释事物并与人交谈。

我有一些销售技能，这是一种特定知识。我也具备一些分析如何赚钱的技能。我还具备这种吸收数据、痴迷于数据并将其分解的能力——这也是我的一种特定技能。我也喜欢摆弄技术。所有这些对我来说都像是玩乐，但在别人眼里却像是工作。

对其他人来说，这些事情可能很难，他们会说，“我如何能在卖点子和推销方面变得厉害呢？”如果你并不擅长或者真的不喜欢这些事情，也许这就不是你的领域——关注你真正喜欢的事情。

第一个指出我真实特定知识的人是我的母亲。她是随口提的，当时在厨房里大概是我十五或十六岁的时候。我告诉我的一个朋友，我想成为一名天体物理学家，而她说：“不，你会进入商业领域。”我当时心想：“什么？我妈说我会从事商业？我要成为天体物理学家。妈妈不知道自己在说什么。”但妈妈完全知道自己在说什么。[78]

特定知识更多是通过追随你的天赋、真诚的好奇心和热情来找到的。它不是通过去学校学习那些热门职业找到的，也不是通过进入投资者说是热门的领域找到的。

通常，特定知识位于知识的边缘地带。这也意味着它是一些刚刚被发现或者非常难以掌握的东西。如果你不是百分之百投入，那个对这件事百分之百投入的人会超越你。而且他们不会只略微超越你——他们会远远超越你，因为我们现在处于思想领域，复利和杠杆效应真的发挥作用了。[78]

> 互联网大大拓宽了职业的可能空间。大多数人还没有意识到这一点。

你可以上网找到你的受众。你可以建立一个业务，创造产品，通过互联网独特地表达自己，获得财富并让人们感到快乐。[78]

互联网使得任何小众兴趣只要你是这个领域最优秀的人，就能够扩展。好消息是，因为每个人类都是不同的，每个人都在某方面是最优秀的——就是做自己。

我还有一个推文值得融入进来，但没有放进“如何致富”的推文中，那就是非常简单的一句话：“通过真诚逃离竞争。”基本上，当你与人竞争时，是因为你在模仿他们。是因为你试图做同样的事情。但每个人类都是不同的。不要复制别人。[78] (*点击推文)

如果你从根本上在构建和营销一些源于你自身的东西，没有人可以在这方面与你竞争。谁能和乔·罗根或斯科特·亚当斯竞争？不可能。有谁能写出比《戴尔伯特》更好的作品吗？不可能。有谁能和比尔·沃特森竞争，创作出比《加尔文与霍布斯》更好的作品吗？不可能。他们是真诚的。[78]

> 最好的工作既不是被规定的，也不是被学位授予的。它们是自由市场中不断学习者的创造性表达。

致富的最重要技能是成为一个永远的学习者。你必须知道如何学习任何你想学的东西。旧的赚钱模式是上四年大学，获得学位，然后当三十年的专业人士。但现在事情变化得非常快。现在，你必须在九个月内掌握一个新职业，而四年后它就过时了。但在那三年内的生产期，你可以非常富有。

今天更重要的是在九到十二个月内成为一个全新领域的专家，而不是很久以前学对了某件事情。你真正关心的是你是否学到了基础知识，以至于你不害怕任何书。如果你去图书馆，发现有一本你无法理解的书，你必须深入思考，“我需要学习哪些基础才能理解它？”基础知识非常重要。[74]

基本的算术和数感在生活中比微积分更重要。同样，用普通英语词汇清楚地表达自己比写诗、拥有丰富的词汇量或会说七种不同的外语更重要。

知道如何在讲话时具有说服力，比成为专家级的数字营销者或点击优化者更为重要。基础是关键。把基础掌握到9/10或10/10要比尝试深入专精其他领域更有用。

你确实需要在某些方面深入钻研，因为否则你就会广泛涉猎却浅尝辄止，无法从生活中得到你想要的东西。你只能在一两件事情上实现精通。而这些通常是你痴迷的事情。[74]
