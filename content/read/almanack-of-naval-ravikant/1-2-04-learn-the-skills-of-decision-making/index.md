### Learn the Skills of Decision-Making

The classical virtues are all decision-making heuristics to make one optimize for the long term rather than for the short term. [11]

> Self-serving conclusions should have a higher bar.

I do view a lot of my goals over the next few years of unconditioning previous learned responses or habituated responses, so I can make decisions more cleanly in the moment without relying on memory or prepackaged heuristics and judgments. [4]

> Almost all biases are time-saving heuristics. For important decisions, discard memory and identity, and focus on the problem.

Radical honesty just means I want to be free. Part of being free means I can say what I think and think what I say. They’re highly congruent and integrated. Theoretical physicist Richard Feynman famously said, “You should never, ever fool anybody, and you are the easiest person to fool.” The moment you tell somebody something dishonest, you’ve lied to yourself. Then you’ll start believing your own lie, which will disconnect you from reality and take you down the wrong road.

> I never ask if “I like it” or “I don’t like it.” I think “this is what it is” or “this is what it isn’t.”  
> —Richard Feynman

It’s really important for me to be honest. I don’t go out of my way volunteering negative or nasty things. I would combine radical honesty with an old rule Warren Buffett has, which is praise specifically, criticize generally. I try to follow this. I don’t always follow it, but I think I follow it enough to have made a difference in my life.

If you have a criticism of someone, then don’t criticize the person—criticize the general approach or criticize the class of activities. If you have to praise somebody, then always try and find the person who is the best example of what you’re praising and praise the person, specifically. Then people’s egos and identities, which we all have, don’t work against you. They work for you. [4]

**Any advice on developing capacity for instinctual blunt honesty?**

Tell everyone. Start now. It doesn’t have to be blunt. Charisma is the ability to project confidence and love at the same time. It’s almost always possible to be honest and positive. [71]

**As an investor and CEO of AngelList, you’re paid to be right when other people are wrong. Do you have a process around how you make decisions?**

Yes. Decision-making is everything. In fact, someone who makes decisions right 80 percent of the time instead of 70 percent of the time will be valued and compensated in the market hundreds of times more.

I think people have a hard time understanding a fundamental fact of leverage. If I manage $1 billion and I’m right 10 percent more often than somebody else, my decision-making creates $100 million worth of value on a judgment call. With modern technology and large workforces and capital, our decisions are leveraged more and more.

If you can be more right and more rational, you’re going to get nonlinear returns in your life. I love the blog Farnam Street because it really focuses on helping you be more accurate, an overall better decision-maker. Decision-making is everything. [4]

### 学习决策技能

经典的美德都是一些决策启发式方法，旨在让人们为长期而非短期进行优化。[11]

> 为了满足自我利益的结论应设更高的标准。

我确实把未来几年的很多目标看作是对之前学会的反应或习惯化反应的去条件化，这样我就可以在当下更干净地做出决定，而不依赖记忆或预先打包的启发式和判断。[4]

> 几乎所有的偏见都是节省时间的启发式方法。对于重要的决策，摒弃记忆和身份，专注于问题本身。

激进的诚实意味着我想要自由。成为自由的一部分意味着我可以说我所想，想我所说。两者高度一致且整合。理论物理学家理查德·费曼曾有名地说：“你永远不应该欺骗任何人，而你是最容易被欺骗的那个人。”当你对某人撒谎的那一刻，你就欺骗了自己。然后你会开始相信自己的谎言，这将使你脱离现实，走上错误的道路。

> 我从不问“我喜欢它”或“我不喜欢它”。我会想“这就是它的本质”或“这不是它的本质”。  
> ——理查德·费曼

对我来说，诚实真的很重要。我不会刻意主动提供负面或恶意的东西。我会将激进的诚实与沃伦·巴菲特的一个老规则结合起来，那就是具体表扬，普遍批评。我尽量遵循这一点。我并不总是做到，但我认为我已经足够遵循它，以至于它在我的生活中产生了影响。

如果你要批评某人，那么不要批评这个人——而是批评一般的方法或这一类行为。如果你要表扬某人，那就总是试着找到最能代表你所赞美内容的人，并具体表扬这个人。这样，我们每个人都有的自我和身份就不会与你对抗，而是为你工作。[4]

**关于培养本能的坦率诚实的能力，有什么建议吗？**

告诉每个人。从现在开始。它不一定是生硬的。魅力是一种同时传递自信和爱的能力。几乎总是可以既诚实又积极的。[71]

**作为投资者和AngelList的CEO，你被支付的原因是在别人错误时你是对的。你有一套决策流程吗？**

有的。决策就是一切。事实上，那些正确率为80%而不是70%的人在市场中的价值和报酬会是几百倍的差距。

我认为人们很难理解杠杆的一个基本事实。如果我管理10亿美元，而我的正确率比别人高10%，那么我的决策在判断中就会创造出1亿美元的价值。借助现代科技、大量的劳动力和资本，我们的决策被不断地放大。

如果你能更正确、更理性，你的生活中就会获得非线性的回报。我喜欢Farnam Street这个博客，因为它真的专注于帮助你变得更准确，更全面地成为一个更好的决策者。决策就是一切。[4]
