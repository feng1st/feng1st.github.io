### Get Paid for Your Judgment

Choosing what kinds of jobs, careers, or fields you get into and what sort of deals you’re willing to take from your employer will give you much more free time. Then, you don’t have to worry as much about time management. I would love to be paid purely for my judgment, not for any work. I want a robot, capital, or computer to do the work, but I want to be paid for my judgment. [1]

I think every human should aspire to being knowledgeable about certain things and being paid for our unique knowledge. We have as much leverage as is possible in our business, whether it’s through robots or computers or what have you. Then, we can be masters of our own time because we are just being tracked on outputs and not inputs.

Imagine someone comes along who demonstrably has slightly better judgment. They’re right 85 percent of the time instead of 75 percent. You will pay them $50 million, $100 million, $200 million, whatever it takes, because 10 percent better judgment steering a $100 billion ship is very valuable. CEOs are highly paid because of their leverage. Small differences in judgment and capability really get amplified. [2]

Demonstrated judgment—credibility around the judgment— is so critical. Warren Buffett wins here because he has massive credibility. He’s been highly accountable. He’s been right over and over in the public domain. He’s built a reputation for very high integrity, so you can trust him. People will throw infinite leverage behind him because of his judgment. Nobody asks him how hard he works. Nobody asks him when he wakes up or when he goes to sleep. They’re like, “Warren, just do your thing.”

Judgment—especially demonstrated judgment, with high accountability and a clear track record—is critical. [78]

> We waste our time with short-term thinking and busywork. Warren Buffett spends a year deciding and a day acting. That act lasts decades.

Just from being marginally better, like running a quarter mile a fraction of a second faster, some people get paid a lot more—orders of magnitude more. Leverage magnifies those differences even more. Being at the extreme in your art is very important in the age of leverage. [2]

### 为你的判断获取报酬

选择你想进入的工作、职业或领域，以及你愿意接受的雇主的交易类型，这些都能为你带来更多的自由时间。这样一来，你就不必过于担心时间管理的问题。我希望能纯粹因为我的判断而获得报酬，而不是因为任何工作。我希望有机器人、资本或者电脑来完成工作，而我只想因为我的判断力而获得报酬。[1]

我认为每个人都应该立志去掌握某些知识，并因为我们独特的知识而获得报酬。无论是通过机器人、电脑，还是其他工具，我们在业务中可以获得尽可能多的杠杆。这样，我们就能成为自己时间的主人，因为我们只被评估输出结果，而不是投入的时间。

想象一下，有人拥有显著更好的判断力。他们的判断正确率是85%，而不是75%。你会愿意支付5000万、1亿、2亿美元，不论代价多高，因为10%的判断力提升能够极大地影响一个价值千亿的公司。CEO之所以薪酬丰厚，是因为他们的杠杆能力。判断力和能力的微小差异会被无限放大。[2]

经过验证的判断力——即判断力的可信度——至关重要。沃伦·巴菲特在这方面表现得非常出色，因为他有着巨大的可信度。他的责任感非常强，在公开场合的判断一再被验证是正确的。他建立了高度诚信的声誉，所以你可以信任他。人们愿意为他的判断提供无限的杠杆，因为他值得信赖。没有人会问他工作有多辛苦，也没有人会问他几点起床或几点睡觉。他们只会说：“沃伦，做你的事就好。”

判断力——尤其是有高度责任感和清晰记录的判断力——至关重要。[78]

> 我们浪费时间在短期思考和忙碌的琐事上。沃伦·巴菲特花一年时间做决策，然后花一天时间去执行，而这个行为的效果能持续几十年。

仅仅因为稍微优胜一些，比如跑四分之一英里快了几分之一秒，有些人就能赚得更多，甚至是数量级上的差距。在杠杆的时代，这些差异会被进一步放大。在你的艺术中达到极致，在杠杆的时代尤为重要。[2]
