### Prioritize and Focus

I’ve encountered plenty of bad luck along the way. The first little fortune I made I instantly lost in the stock market. The second little fortune I made, or should have made, I basically got cheated out of by my business partners. It’s only the third time around that has been a charm.

Even then, it has been a slow and steady struggle. I haven’t made money in my life in one giant payout. It has always been a whole bunch of small things piling up. It’s more about consistently creating wealth by creating businesses, creating opportunities, and creating investments. It hasn’t been a giant one-off thing. My personal wealth has not been generated by one big year. It just stacks up a little bit, a few chips at a time: more options, more businesses, more investments, more things I can do.

Thanks to the internet, opportunities are massively abundant. In fact, I have too many ways to make money. I don’t have enough time. I literally have opportunities pouring out of my ears, and I keep running out of time. There are so many ways to create wealth, to create products, to create businesses, and to get paid by society as a byproduct. I just can’t handle them all. [78]

> Value your time at an hourly rate, and ruthlessly spend to save time at that rate. You will never be worth more than you think you’re worth.

No one is going to value you more than you value yourself. You just have to set a very high personal hourly rate and you have to stick to it. Even when I was young, I just decided I was worth a lot more than the market thought I was worth, and I started treating myself that way.

Always factor your time into every decision. How much time does it take? It’s going to take you an hour to get across town to get something. If you value yourself at one hundred dollars an hour, that’s basically throwing one hundred dollars out of your pocket. Are you going to do that? [78]

Fast-forward to your wealthy self and pick some intermediate hourly rate. For me, believe it or not, back when you could have hired me…Which now obviously you can’t, but back when you could have hired me…this was true a decade ago or even two decades ago, before I had any real money. My hourly rate, I used to say to myself over and over, is $5,000 an hour. Today when I look back, really it was about $1,000 an hour.

Of course, I still ended up doing stupid things like arguing with the electrician or returning the broken speaker, but I shouldn’t have, and I did a lot less than any of my friends would. I would make a theatrical show out of throwing something in the trash pile or giving it to Salvation Army rather than trying to return it or handing something to people rather than trying to fix it.

I would argue with my girlfriends, and even today it’s my wife, “I don’t do that. That’s not a problem that I solve.” I still argue that with my mother when she hands me little to-do’s. I just don’t do that. I would rather hire you an assistant. This was true even when I didn’t have money. [78]

Another way of thinking about something is, if you can outsource something or not do something for less than your hourly rate, outsource it or don’t do it. If you can hire someone to do it for less than your hourly rate, hire them. That even includes things like cooking. You may want to eat your healthy home cooked meals, but if you can outsource it, do that instead. [78]

Set a very high hourly aspirational rate for yourself and stick to it. It should seem and feel absurdly high. If it doesn’t, it’s not high enough. Whatever you picked, my advice to you would be to raise it. Like I said, for myself, even before I had money, for the longest time I used $5,000 an hour. And if you extrapolate that out into what it looks like as an annual salary, it’s multiple millions of dollars per year.

Ironically, I actually think I’ve beaten it. I’m not the hardest working person—I’m actually a lazy person. I work through bursts of energy where I’m really motivated with something. If I actually look at how much I’ve earned per actual hour that I’ve put in, it’s probably quite a bit higher than that. [78]

**Can you expand on your statement, “If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you”?**

If you get into a relative mindset, you’re always going to hate people who do better than you, you’re always going to be jealous or envious of them. They’ll sense those feelings when you try and do business with them. When you try and do business with somebody, if you have any bad thoughts or any judgments about them, they will feel it. Humans are wired to feel what the other person deep down inside feels. You have to get out of a relative mindset. [10]

Literally, being anti-wealth will prevent you from becoming wealthy, because you will not have the right mindset for it, you won’t have the right spirit, and you won’t be dealing with people on the right level. Be optimistic, be positive. It’s important. Optimists actually do better in the long run. [10]

> The business world has many people playing zero sum games and a few playing positive sum games searching for each other in the crowd.

There are fundamentally two huge games in life that people play. One is the money game. Because money is not going to solve all of your problems, but it’s going to solve all of your money problems. People realize that, so they want to make money.

But at the same time, many of them, deep down, believe they can’t make money. They don’t want any wealth creation to happen. So, they attack the whole enterprise by saying, “Well, making money is evil. You shouldn’t do it.”

But they’re actually playing the other game, which is the status game. They’re trying to be high status in the eyes of other people watching by saying, “Well, I don’t need money. We don’t want money.” Status is your ranking in the social hierarchy. [78]

> Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive-sum game. Status is an old zero-sum game. Those attacking wealth creation are often just seeking status.

Status is a zero-sum game. It’s a very old game. We’ve been playing it since monkey tribes. It’s hierarchical. Who’s number one? Who’s number two? Who’s number three? And for number three to move to number two, number two has to move out of that slot. So, status is a zero-sum game.

Politics is an example of a status game. Even sports are an example of a status game. To be the winner, there must be a loser. I don’t fundamentally love status games. They play an important role in our society, so we can figure out who’s in charge. But fundamentally, you play them because they’re a necessary evil. [78]

The problem is, to win at a status game, you have to put somebody else down. That’s why you should avoid status games in your life—they make you into an angry, combative person. You’re always fighting to put other people down, to put yourself and the people you like up.

Status games are always going to exist. There’s no way around it, but realize most of the time, when you’re trying to create wealth and you’re getting attacked by someone else, they’re trying to increase their own status at your expense. They’re playing a different game. And it’s a worse game. It’s a zero-sum game instead of a positive-sum game. [78]

> Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

**What is the most important thing to do for younger people starting out?**

Spend more time making the big decisions. There are basically three really big decisions you make in your early life: where you live, who you’re with, and what you do.

We spend very little time deciding which relationship to get into. We spend so much time in a job, but we spend so little time deciding which job to get into. Choosing what city to live in can almost completely determine the trajectory of your life, but we spend so little time trying to figure out what city to live in.

> Advice to a young engineer considering moving to San Francisco: “Do you want to leave your friends behind? Or be the one left behind?”

If you’re going to live in a city for ten years, if you’re going to be in a job for five years, if you’re in a relationship for a decade, you should be spending one to two years deciding these things. These are highly dominating decisions. Those three decisions really matter.

You have to say no to everything and free up your time so you can solve the important problems. Those three are probably the three biggest ones. [1]

**What are one or two steps you’d take to surround yourself with successful people?**

Figure out what you’re good at, and start helping other people with it. Give it away. Pay it forward. Karma works because people are consistent. On a long enough timescale, you will attract what you project. But don’t measure—your patience will run out if you count. [7]

> An old boss once warned: “You’ll never be rich since you’re obviously smart, and someone will always offer you a job that’s just good enough.”

**How did you decide to start your first company?**

I was working at this tech company called @Home Network, and I told everybody around me—my boss, coworkers, my friends, “In Silicon Valley, all of these other people are starting companies. It looks like they can do it. I’m going to start a company. I’m just here temporarily. I’m an entrepreneur.”

…I didn’t actually mean to trick myself into it. It wasn’t a deliberate, calculated thing.

I was just venting, talking out loud, being overly honest. But I didn’t actually start a company. This was in 1996, it was a much scarier, more difficult proposition to start a company then. Sure enough, everyone started saying “What are you still doing here? I thought you were leaving to start a company?” and “Wow, you’re still here…” I was literally embarrassed into starting my own company. [5]

Yes, I know some people aren’t necessarily ready to be entrepreneurs, but long-term, where did we come up with this idea the correct logical thing to do is for everybody to work for somebody else? It is a very hierarchical model. [14]

### 优先排序并专注

一路上我遇到了不少坏运气。我第一次赚到的一小笔财富瞬间就在股市中赔光了。第二次赚到的一小笔财富，或者说本该赚到的，我基本上被我的商业伙伴们骗走了。直到第三次，我才终于获得了好运。

即便如此，这一路也是缓慢而坚定的斗争。我这一生并不是靠一次性的大笔收益赚到钱的。一直以来，都是许多小成就积累起来的。这更多是关于通过创办企业、创造机会和进行投资来持续创造财富，而不是依赖于一次性的大事件。我个人的财富并不是通过某一年突然发大财产生的，而是一点一点累积的：更多的选择、更多的企业、更多的投资、更多我可以做的事情。

感谢互联网，机会现在异常丰富。实际上，我有太多赚钱的方式，而没有足够的时间。我真的有太多机会都从我的耳边流逝，我的时间却总是用光。有太多方法可以创造财富、创造产品、创建企业，并通过为社会提供价值来获得回报，我只是应付不过来。 [78]

> 以小时计算你的时间价值，并且毫不犹豫地花钱去节省在这个时薪范围内的时间。你永远不会比你认为自己值得的更多。

没有人会比你自己更重视你自己。你只需要设定一个非常高的个人时薪，并坚持下去。即使我年轻的时候，我就决定了我比市场认为的我值更多钱，然后我开始以这样的方式对待自己。

始终将你的时间纳入每一个决策中。需要多少时间？如果你要花一个小时穿越整个城市去得到某样东西，如果你给自己的估值是每小时一百美元，那么这基本上就相当于从你的口袋里扔掉了一百美元。你会这么做吗？ [78]

快进到你富有的自己，并选择一个中间的时薪。对我来说，信不信由你，当你还能雇用我的时候……现在显然不行了，但在你还可以雇用我的时候……这在十年前甚至二十年前，我还没有真正赚到钱的时候，我对自己反复说的是，我的时薪是5000美元。今天，当我回想起来，实际上大约是每小时1000美元。

当然，我还是做了一些愚蠢的事情，比如和电工争吵或退还坏掉的音箱，但我不应该这样做，尽管如此，我做这些的次数比我的朋友们少得多。我会把某些东西扔到垃圾堆或者捐给救世军，而不是尝试退还它，或者把东西交给别人而不是自己去修理。

我会和我的女朋友争论，即使到今天，我和我的妻子也会说：“我不做那个，那不是我解决的问题。” 我现在还会和我母亲争论，当她给我一些小任务的时候。我就是不做这些。我宁可为你雇一个助理。即使我当时没有钱，这也是真的。 [78]

另一种思考某件事的方法是，如果你可以将某件事外包出去，或者不做某件事所需的成本低于你的时薪，那就外包它或者不做它。如果你可以花比你的时薪更低的钱雇人做，那就雇人做。这甚至包括了烹饪。你可能想要吃健康的家庭自制餐，但如果你能将其外包出去，那就这么做。 [78]

为自己设定一个非常高的理想时薪并坚持下去。它应该看起来并让你感觉荒谬地高。如果没有，那就不够高。无论你选了多少，我的建议是再提高一些。就像我说的，即使在我还没钱的时候，长时间以来，我用的时薪是5000美元。如果你把它推算成年薪，那就是每年数百万美元。

讽刺的是，我实际上认为我已经超越了它。我并不是最努力工作的人——其实我是一个懒惰的人。我是通过一阵阵的能量迸发来工作的，当我真的对某件事情有动力的时候。如果我真的看看我每个实际投入的小时赚了多少钱，可能远高于这个数值。 [78]

**你能扩展一下你说的“如果你在内心深处鄙视财富，它将会避开你”这句话吗？**

如果你进入了一种相对的思维方式，你就会一直讨厌那些比你做得更好的人，你会一直嫉妒他们。当你试图与他们做生意时，他们会感觉到这些情绪。当你试图与某人做生意，如果你对他们有任何不好的想法或评判，他们会感觉到它。人类天生就能感受到对方内心深处的感受。你必须摆脱相对的思维方式。 [10]

从字面上看，反财富的态度会阻止你变得富有，因为你没有合适的心态，也没有合适的精神状态，也无法与他人处于同等水平。保持乐观，保持积极。这很重要。乐观主义者从长远来看表现得更好。 [10]

> 商业世界里有很多人玩零和游戏，而有一些人玩正和游戏，在人群中寻找彼此。

在人生中，人们玩的根本上有两个大游戏。一个是金钱游戏。因为金钱并不能解决你所有的问题，但它能解决你所有的金钱问题。人们意识到了这一点，所以他们想赚钱。

但与此同时，他们中的很多人内心深处认为自己无法赚钱。他们不希望财富的创造发生。因此，他们通过说“赚钱是邪恶的，你不应该这样做”来攻击整个企业。

但实际上他们是在玩另一个游戏，也就是地位游戏。他们通过说“我不需要钱，我们不想要钱”来试图在其他人眼中获得高地位。地位是你在社会等级中的排名。 [78]

> 财富创造是进化上最近的正和游戏。地位是一个古老的零和游戏。那些攻击财富创造的人往往只是在追求地位。

地位是一个零和游戏。这是一个非常古老的游戏。我们从猴群时代起就一直在玩它。这是等级性的。谁是第一？谁是第二？谁是第三？而第三名要想升到第二名，第二名就必须腾出那个位置。因此，地位是一个零和游戏。

政治就是一个地位游戏的例子。甚至体育也是一个地位游戏的例子。要成为赢家，必须有一个输家。我并不根本喜欢地位游戏。它们在我们的社会中起着重要作用，所以我们可以知道谁在掌权。但从根本上来说，你玩这些游戏是因为它们是必要的恶。 [78]

问题是，要赢得地位游戏，你必须贬低其他人。这就是为什么你应该在生活中避免地位游戏——它们会让你成为一个愤怒、好斗的人。你总是在努力贬低其他人，以抬高自己和你喜欢的人。

地位游戏总是会存在。没有办法绕过它，但要意识到，大多数时候，当你试图创造财富而被其他人攻击时，他们是在以你的代价提高自己的地位。他们在玩一个不同的游戏。而这是一个更差的游戏。这是一个零和游戏，而不是正和游戏。 [78]

> 玩愚蠢的游戏，赢得愚蠢的奖品。

**对刚起步的年轻人来说，最重要的事情是什么？**

花更多时间做重大决策。你早期生活中基本上有三个真正重要的决策：你住在哪里，你和谁在一起，以及你做什么。

我们在决定进入哪段关系时花的时间很少。我们花很多时间在工作中，但我们在决定要做哪份工作上花的时间却很少。选择住在哪个城市几乎可以完全决定你的人生轨迹，但我们花很少时间去思考住在哪个城市。

> 给考虑搬到旧金山的年轻工程师的建议：“你是想离开你的朋友，还是被朋友们抛下？”

如果你打算在一个城市住十年，如果你要在一份工作中待五年，如果你在一段关系中持续十年，你应该花一到两年的时间来决定这些事情。这些是高度决定性的决策。这三项决策非常重要。

你必须对所有事情说“不”，腾出时间来解决重要的问题。这三件事可能是最重要的三件。 [1]

**你会采取哪一两步来让自己周围都是成功的人？**

找出你擅长的事情，并开始帮助别人。把它送出去。向前支付。因果报应起作用是因为人们是一致的。在足够长的时间尺度上，你会吸引与你投射出的相似的事物。但不要计较——如果你数数，你的耐心会耗尽。 [7]

> 一位老上司曾经警告：“你永远不会富有，因为你显然很聪明，总会有人给你提供一份还不错的工作。”

**你是如何决定开始你的第一家公司？**

我当时在一家名为@Home Network的科技公司工作，我告诉我周围的每个人——我的老板、同事、我的朋友，“在硅谷，所有其他人都在创办公司。看起来他们也能做到。我也要创办公司。我只是在这里暂时待一下。我是一个企业家。”

……我并不是真的有意欺骗自己。这并不是一个深思熟虑的事情。

我只是发泄，随口说出来，过于诚实。但我并没有真的开始一家公司。这是在1996年，那时创办公司是一个更加可怕、更加困难的事情。果然，大家开始说“你还在这里做什么？我以为你要离开创办公司？”和“哇，你还在这里……”我真的因为感到尴尬而创办了自己的公司。 [5]

是的，我知道有些人可能并不一定准备好成为企业家，但从长远来看，我们是从哪里得出这样的结论，认为每个人都应该为别人工作才是正确的逻辑呢？这是一个非常等级化的模式。 [14]
